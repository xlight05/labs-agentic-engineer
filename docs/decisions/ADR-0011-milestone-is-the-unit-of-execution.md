# ADR-0011 — A GitHub milestone is the unit of execution

Delivery used to execute a spec version **task by task**. The planner wrote each
task issue with an embedded `aep:task/v1` machine block naming its component and
its `dependsOn` edges; two independent layers then re-derived a dependency
order from that block — an execution funnel with a `depsGate`, and a Temporal
`DevFlowWorkflow` fanning out one `TaskFlowWorkflow` per task. One coding-agent
pod was dispatched per issue, and a `v<N>` tag keyed everything: the workflow
ids, an `aep:spec/<tag>` label on every issue, the build reads, the console.
Progress was a ten-value derived-status algebra computed from execution rows.

Three things were wrong with it. The platform **parsed issue bodies it had
written itself**, so the issue was a database record wearing a prose costume and
a human editing it could corrupt the pipeline. The **dependency order was
computed twice**, in two places that could disagree, from a plan an LLM authored
and could not be held to. And **one pod per issue** meant N cold starts, N
workspaces, N pull requests, and no agent ever saw enough of the increment to
sequence its own work.

## Decision

**One spec version is one GitHub milestone, and one supervised run works that
milestone until it settles.**

- **The milestone is the version.** It is titled after the `v<N>` tag, and its
  **number** is the platform key everywhere. `aep:spec/<tag>` is dead; a
  `?tag=` query resolves to a milestone number through the platform's own run
  rows, never by matching titles against GitHub. The milestone is also the
  version's **ledger** — fix, conflict, validation and incident issues join it
  over its life.
- **Nothing platform-side parses an issue body.** Bodies are prose the platform
  writes *for the agent*: what to build, its App Path, and "Depends on #N" lines
  the **agent** honours. Every routable fact is a LABEL (`aep` = agent work,
  `aep:provision` = a dispatch gate, `aep:validation`, `aep:codingagent` =
  adoption). Re-plan dedupes on the title slug against the milestone's own
  issues, which makes reconcile additive-only.
- **One agent per cycle, not per issue.** The dispatch prompt is a milestone
  reference; the runner discovers its own working set, orders it, fans out to
  Task subagents where the work is genuinely independent, and ships **one
  agent-validated pull request per cycle** carrying `Resolves #N` for every
  issue it finished. Both task kinds run on one Debian runner image.
- **The event plane detects; the supervisor decides.** Webhooks and OpenChoreo
  polls auto-merge the pull request, fan a merge out to a build per changed
  component by path-diff, mint fix / conflict / red-main issues, and *signal*.
  A slim per-run Temporal workflow (`run-<org>-<project>-<milestoneNumber>`)
  owns the wait state, the cycle loop, the budgets, the validation cycle and
  settle — and imports no GitHub client. That dependency direction is a compiled
  package boundary, not a convention.
- **A signal is a wake-up, never evidence.** The supervisor re-reads ground
  truth before acting, so a lost webhook costs latency rather than correctness —
  which is what lets the wait state be unbounded with cancel as its only expiry.
- **Every budget names exactly one failure class**, so a terminal reason is an
  explanation: `redispatch-budget`, `build-retrigger-budget`, `fix-chain-budget`,
  `conflict-budget`, `no-progress`, `cycle-ceiling`, `validation-failed`.
- **Re-planning is supersede-on-next-build.** The next build closes the previous
  version's still-open issues with a `Superseded by v<N+1>` comment and then the
  milestone itself, and plans `v<N+1>` fresh from the new spec. Cancel abandons
  an increment; the only way forward is the next build.

The mechanism — package shape, ports, and the full invariant list — is
documented where it is enforced: [`internal/delivery/README.md`][delivery] (L2)
under the README ladder ([ADR-0008][adr8]).

## The read model this forces

Loop position is **never a stored phase enum**. A fix or conflict cycle
re-enters an earlier phase, so a flat enum lies mid-loop; position renders from
the latest **cycle record**, joined live. Per-component build and deploy status
is derived from OpenChoreo on read, never stored.

Reads split into **two planes, priced apart**:

| Plane | Source | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Run rows + cycle records (`/builds`, `/builds/{tag}/runs`, `/runs/{id}/progress`) | Postgres, fed by webhooks | free to poll at 5s |
| Issues (`/tasks?tag=`) | GitHub, live | polled only while a run is live, plus one fetch at settle |

Consequently **`ProjectStatus` carries no task tally**. Its only honest source
is the version's milestone on GitHub and that endpoint is polled at 5s, so the
console renders counts from the issue list it already holds, on the surface that
already pays for it. For the same reason the run state — not a task's status —
is the console's single liveness driver.

The console rendering that follows from this is a console decision:
[`apps/console/design/decisions/ADR-0013-version-run-surface.md`][console-adr].

## Consequences

**Accepted costs.**

- **A whole cycle is the unit of retry.** When an agent dies, the cycle is
  re-dispatched, not one issue — bounded at 2 dispatches per cycle.
- **No pre-merge build verification.** An in-pod container build gate was
  designed and prototyped, then dropped: it required rootless podman with
  `--isolation=chroot` and *both* seccomp and AppArmor unconfined, inside the
  pod that carries the Anthropic key and the GitHub token. The post-merge
  OpenChoreo build is the only build verification, so a broken Dockerfile
  reaches `main` and costs one of the run's two fix cycles to catch. The agent's
  **compile-level** verification (`go build` / `tsc --noEmit`) stays — it needs
  no container runtime.
- **The agent's plan is not auditable as data.** Ordering is prose an agent
  interprets; there is no dependency graph to inspect or to test against.
- **No milestone backfill.** Cutover was drain-and-abandon: versions built
  before it show an empty issue list, and incident adoption on a project last
  deployed pre-cutover errors clearly until the first post-cutover build heals
  it.

**What we no longer maintain.** Two dependency layers, `DevFlowWorkflow` /
`TaskFlowWorkflow` / `depsGate`, the executions store as an agent-work record,
the ten-value derived-status algebra, and the machine-block encoding —
`contracts/taskmeta`'s `block.go`, `derive.go` and `labels.go`. `derivedStatus`
survives as two values, `pending` (the issue is open) and `merged` (closed),
both deliberately members of the retired vocabulary because the console consumes
the field untyped. `taskmeta/execution.go` survives too: provisioning gates still
keep execution rows, and `TestTaskmetaIsPure` still guards it.

**A lesson worth keeping.** The milestone dispatch predicate shipped believing
GitHub GraphQL's `labels:` argument was an AND. It is a **union** — the
AND-semantics is real but belongs to the REST `?labels=a,b` parameter. Every
`gittest` fake modelled the same misconception, so the whole tier stayed green
while the live working set read zero and runs settled versions nobody had built.
A fake answers whatever the test authored: it is evidence of parsing, never of
semantics. Where a query's *meaning* is load-bearing, confirm it against the
real host once and record the answer next to the query.
