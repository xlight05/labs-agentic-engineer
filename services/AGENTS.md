# AGENTS.md — services/

| New | Tech |
|---|---|
| `aep-api/`| Go BFF + GitHub webhooks (git ops folded in) |
| `agents/` | TS interactive spec agents (Vercel AI SDK) |
| `collab/`|  TS Yjs collaboration server |

## Conventions

- Config/env parsing in one place per service; add every var to `.env.example`.

## Documentation — current state, never a plan

- Every `README.md` / `design/` doc describes the **shipped end state**, not the journey. No
  migration/phase language ("defer to P9", "not yet carved", "still in models/"). Plans live in
  issues/PRs, not the tree.
- `aep-api` is documented as a **README ladder** ([`aep-api/README.md`](aep-api/README.md), ADR-0008):
  the service README is the map hub (domains · conventions · cross-cutting invariants); each domain
  README covers that domain (Slices · Ports · Owns · Invariants); `internal/arch` tests are the
  executable truth. Cross-cutting rules live once at the hub, not per domain.
- Change the architecture → update its README in the **same commit**. A README describing a superseded
  layout is a bug.

## Practices

- Test driven developement is preferred. Write tests first, then implement the feature. Define the contrract first, then write the test case for that contract, then implement the feature. You can tweak along the way.
- API changes are contract-first: edit `packages/contracts/api/`, run `make gen-api`, and let the strict-server compile errors drive the handler updates.
- Before making changes, think on the code stucture and where does the change belong. 
- Dead code is gated (`aep-api`): `make -C aep-api deadcode-check` fails on any function unreachable from the `cmd/aep-api` main — tests do **not** count as callers. Keep an intentional test seam or unwired infra with a `//deadcode:keep <reason>` marker; rationale is inline in `aep-api/scripts/deadcode.sh`.
  The gate pins the Go toolchain to `go.mod`'s `go` directive (an older one cannot load the
  packages) and hard-fails if `deadcode` itself does not run, so it can never pass by analysing nothing.
