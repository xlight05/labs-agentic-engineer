// SKILL.md 1:1 plus a few derived fields. (The coding runner no longer receives
// this shape over the wire — it clones `org-skills` and resolves applied skills
// locally.)
//
// Lives in models (the shared value-type layer) so the skills feature and its
// consumers can reference it without crossing a feature boundary. The skills
// package keeps a `type Skill = models.Skill` alias.
