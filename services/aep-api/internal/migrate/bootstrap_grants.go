// RunBootstrapGrants restores the connecting role's full privilege set on
// objects it owns in the public schema. Runs before any other migration.
//
// Some managed-DB setups provision the app role via an out-of-band
// hardening step that REVOKEs everything and re-grants only DML
// (INSERT/SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE). The owner retains ALTER (an owner-only
// check that bypasses the ACL) so column-level migrations keep working,
// but raw `CREATE TABLE … REFERENCES <owned-table>` fails with
// `permission denied for table <owned-table>` because REFERENCES is an
// ACL bit that was stripped.
//
// Owners can always GRANT to themselves, so this is a safe self-heal:
// no-op when fine, recovery when an out-of-band REVOKE has run.
// Errors are logged and swallowed so a more locked-down environment
// can still reach the diagnostic specific migration errors that follow.
