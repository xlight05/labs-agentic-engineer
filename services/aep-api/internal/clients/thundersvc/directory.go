package thundersvc

// directory.go — the group/user half of the Thunder admin surface, used by the
// build-time roles ensure to make a project's declared roles and test users
// real. Everything here lands in the DEFAULT organization unit, matching where
// the thunder-app operator registers every generated app's OAuth client: a user
// in a different OU is not a user of the app.
//
// Three Thunder facts shape this file, all established against a running
// Thunder 0.34.0 rather than read from documentation:
//
//  1. **Group membership can only be set when the group is CREATED.**
//     `PUT /groups/{id}` accepts a `members` array, answers 200, and silently
//     ignores it; there is no `POST/PUT/PATCH /groups/{id}/members` (404/405)
//     and no SCIM surface. So changing the membership of an existing group
//     means delete-and-recreate with the whole list — see rewriteGroupMembers,
//     which is the only place in this file that does it.
//
//     Membership is READABLE from both ends, though: `/groups/{id}/members`
//     lists a group's accounts and `/users/{id}/groups` lists an account's
//     groups. The second one is what makes un-enrolling on delete possible at
//     all (see UserGroups) — without it, removing an account from its roles
//     would mean scanning every group in the directory.
//
//  2. **The directory has NO referential integrity between users and group
//     membership.** `DELETE /users/{id}` leaves every group that account
//     belonged to pointing at an id that no longer resolves, and a `POST
//     /groups` carrying such an id is rejected WHOLESALE with
//     `400 GRP-1007 Invalid user member ID` — which names no id, so the
//     rejection does not say which member was the bad one.
//
//     Those two facts together are a data-loss machine, and it has fired: the
//     only membership write is a delete-then-create, its payload is built from
//     membership the directory itself corrupts, and the destructive half goes
//     first. A group whose member list named a deleted account was DESTROYED
//     by the next build that tried to enrol somebody into it, permanently,
//     because the failure is deterministic and every retry repeated it.
//     rewriteGroupMembers exists to make that outcome impossible: it proves
//     every id resolves before it deletes anything, and it brings the group
//     back — empty if it must — if the create fails anyway.
//  3. **Passwords are write-only on read-back, but `PUT /users/{id}` echoes the
//     submitted password in plaintext.** Same value the caller sent, so no new
//     disclosure — but that response body must never reach a log or an error
//     string. setUserAttributes is the one place that PUTs a user, and it
//     deliberately does not read the body on success and does not interpolate
//     it on failure.
//  4. **There is no server-side filter, and the groups listing does not even
//     REJECT one.** `GET /users?filter=…` is a 400, so finding a user by
//     username is a bounded client-side scan. `GET /groups?userId=…` is worse:
//     it answers 200 and silently returns every group, so a caller that
//     believed it filtered would act on the whole directory. Nothing here
//     passes a filter parameter to either.
//
// Requests here go through doJSON rather than the hand-rolled blocks the
// application half of this client uses. That is deliberate scope control: the
// new surface gets the helper, the shipped surface is left alone.
