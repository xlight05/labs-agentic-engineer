package spec

// The Go export_test.go pattern: exported test-only helpers that let the
// EXTERNAL component-test package (skills_test, which must live outside package
// skills to break the api→skills import cycle) build a REAL *SkillService over
// the engine-backed git fixture the repo_store_test.go pattern provides (a
// gitfs engine rooted in t.TempDir() + one real bare file:// origin per org) —
// without duplicating the host or reaching its unexported doubles. This is the
// engine-injection seam the later ports (files/artifacts, Phases 2–3) reuse:
// production gateway (sourcecontrol.NewGitOpsService) + workspacetest engine + a
// RepoService fake whose rows carry file:// CloneURLs and a pinned RepoSlug.
// These symbols are compiled only into the test binary.
