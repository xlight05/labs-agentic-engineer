// Package runread is the milestone run's READ surface: a version's runs and
// their cycles, one SSE stream stitching those cycles' agent logs, and the
// cancel write behind them.
//
// It is a read model, so it owns no state and decides nothing. Everything it
// serves is either a row the supervisor and the event plane already wrote, or a
// pod log — and cancel is a single call straight through to the supervisor.
//
// Two data planes, priced separately (design §10): run rows and cycle records
// are webhook-fed DB reads that cost nothing to poll, while the GitHub-backed
// issue list lives on the tasks read and is polled only while a run is live.
// Nothing here touches GitHub.
//
// Why a slice of its own rather than a corner of `run`: `run` is the Temporal
// supervisor, and the read surface must not drag a workflow engine into an HTTP
// GET. It names its collaborators as ports and imports only the delivery root —
// `RunStatus`, `MilestoneRunWorkflowID` and the run/cycle entities live there
// precisely so this package can use them without importing a sibling slice.
