// Reads is the live read path: GitHub issues, read now, with no cache and no
// read model.
//
// What it reads is MILESTONE MEMBERSHIP plus LABELS, and nothing else. Issue
// bodies are prose — the platform authors them for the agent and never parses
// them back — so a Task view carries the facts GitHub holds (number, title,
// state, labels, body) joined with the execution rows the platform still owns
// for provisioning gates. Everything the retired machine block used to supply
// (component, dependsOn, lineage, origin, the ten-value derived status) is
// either gone or now a property of the RUN, which is read from the run rows.

// ListByTag returns a project's Tasks, filtered by GitHub state ("open" |
// "closed" | "all"; default "open") and optionally scoped to one spec/build
// version tag.
//
// THE TAG IS MILESTONE MEMBERSHIP. It resolves `v<N>` to a milestone NUMBER
// through the platform's own run rows and then lists that milestone — never by
// matching titles against GitHub, whose milestone titles are renamable and
// whose title filters are case-insensitive while its create-uniqueness is not.
// An unknown tag is an empty list, not an error: a version this platform never
// built has no Tasks by definition.
//
// An empty tag returns every version, which costs two label-scoped queries
// because GitHub's `labels=` is AND-semantics and the two populations (agent
// work, dispatch gates) carry disjoint labels.
//
// The validation issue is excluded at this boundary, as it always was: it is a
// phase of the run, not an implementation Task, and it surfaces on the
// deployment surface with the run's verdict.
//
// Bare LEDGER issues — human-filed issues that joined the milestone carrying
// none of the platform's labels — are returned by the tag-scoped read and only
// by it. They are never worked and never stall settle (§7), but they are part
// of the version's ledger and the console sections them apart from agent work.
// The untagged read cannot see them: it is two label queries, and a ledger
// issue is defined by carrying no label to query on. Milestone membership is
