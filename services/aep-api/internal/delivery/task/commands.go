// Commands is the Task write surface: one operation, the dispatch leg of the
// SRE/RCA alert handoff (AE-HANDOFF-DESIGN.md). The caller files an ordinary
// GitHub issue first and then calls this to hand it to the coding agent.
//
// There is no execute/hold/unhold here any more. Work is dispatched by the RUN
// SUPERVISOR over a milestone, not per issue, so the only write a human or an
// external tool makes is adoption: put an issue in a version's milestone and
// let the run pick it up.

// PromoteAndExecute hands an ad-hoc GitHub issue — one filed outside the
// spec-plan pipeline, e.g. by the OpenChoreo SRE/RCA agent handoff — to the

//
// It is adoption, and nothing more: the issue body the caller wrote is left
// exactly as it is (bodies are prose the agent reads, and nothing platform-side
// parses them), the issue joins the DEPLOYED version's milestone, and an
// incident run is started over that milestone unless one is already live — in
// which case the live run picks the issue up at its next cycle boundary.
//
// componentName must name a component the platform already knows about. The
// check is synchronous here so an unknown name (e.g. a caller's prefix-
// stripping bug) fails this call rather than surfacing later inside a cycle.
//
// Idempotent: a repeated call re-adopts an issue that is already in the
// milestone, which is a no-op.
