// Package task is the GitHub-facing half of the Task/Execution split
// (docs/design/tasks-github-native.md §1, §10.1). A Task IS a GitHub issue —
// its labels, body (machine block + rationale + scope), open/closed state, and
// linked PRs. This package reads Tasks live from GitHub joined with their
// executions to compute derived status (reads.go), plans Tasks on the agents
// service and executes the tool-call stream against GitHub mid-flight (plan.go /
// plan_tap.go), stamps command labels (commands.go), composes issue bodies over
// the machine block (issue_compose.go), and handles issues.* webhooks — task
// birth, block validation/repair, close/reopen, attention (events.go). It never
// stores a Task status (that is derived) and never imports the platform-owned
// execution half — the §1 split is a package boundary (arch-locked).
