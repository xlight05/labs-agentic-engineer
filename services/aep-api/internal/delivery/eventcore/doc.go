// Package eventcore is the delivery domain's EVENT PLANE: it detects, mints
// and signals — the run supervisor decides.
//
// Everything it does is a reaction to ground truth arriving from outside:
// GitHub webhooks (pull requests, issues) and OpenChoreo build terminals. Its
// outputs are exactly three kinds: a squash-merge, an issue minted into a
// milestone, and a signal to the run supervisor.
//
// # No Temporal
//
// This package imports no workflow engine, deliberately. The dependency
// direction of the architecture — supervisor consumes the event plane, never
// the reverse — is expressed here as a package boundary: the supervisor is
// reachable only through the RunSignaler and RunStarter ports, so no decision
// about a run's loop can be smuggled in here. What lands in this package is
// only ever "this happened", never "therefore do that".
//
// # The run row IS the gate
//
// Every handler resolves a milestone RUN ROW first and returns without side
// effects when there is none. That is not defensive coding, it is the safety
// property that lets this package be fully wired and fully tested while the
// legacy pull_request handlers are still live: the webhook router runs ALL
// handlers registered for a key, and two auto-mergers racing on one PR would
// be a genuine disaster. Nothing creates milestone run rows until the plan
// path mints them, so in production every handler here is inert — provably,
// by a lookup, rather than by a feature flag somebody can flip early.
//
// The rule holds even where a run is deliberately absent. Adoption of a bare
// issue resolves the DEPLOYED version's milestone through run rows; the red-main
// incident path does the same. No run rows, no milestone, no write.
//
// # Idempotency
//
// A webhook delivery whose handler failed is REDELIVERED and re-run (the
// receiver's Persist reports the row as neither fresh nor processed, and
// dispatch happens again), so every handler here must be safe to run twice.
// Three mechanisms carry that weight, and none of them is a "have we seen
// this" table:
//
//   - merging re-reads the live pull request first, so a second delivery of a
//     merged PR merges nothing;
//   - minting passes a DedupeKey, which resolves to an existing OPEN issue
//     carrying the derived dedupe label instead of filing a second one;
//   - triggering a build counts the WorkflowRuns OpenChoreo already holds for
//     (component, commit) and refuses to exceed the allowance — which is the
//     SAME mechanism as the automatic re-trigger budget, so idempotency and
//     the budget can never disagree.
//
// # Echo suppression is issues-only
//
// The issues.* handlers drop deliveries whose sender is the platform's own
// GitHub identity: every label, comment and milestone assignment the platform
// writes fires an issues.* delivery straight back at it.
//
// It is deliberately NOT applied to pull_request.*. In App mode the coding
// runner opens its PR as <slug>[bot] — the SAME login as the platform identity
// — so suppressing self-sender PR deliveries would drop the runner's own
// pull_request.opened and strand the run waiting for a PR that already exists.
// The PR is the runner's report, not a platform projection, so its deliveries
// are always acted on.
