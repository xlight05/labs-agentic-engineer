// Issue minting — the uniform rule: EVERY platform-detected failure becomes an
// issue in a milestone. Recovery work then looks exactly like ordinary work,
// which is why the loop needs no separate recovery machinery: the next cycle
// picks a fix or conflict issue out of the working set like any other.
//
// Bodies are PROSE. Nothing parses an issue body platform-side — not this
// package, not the supervisor, not the reads. The one structured fact any of
// them carries is a conflict issue naming its pull request, and even that is a
// reference for the AGENT (it derives its rebase target from it), not a field
// the platform reads back.
//
// Every mint passes a DedupeKey, which the issue service resolves against the
// OPEN issues already carrying the derived dedupe label. That is what makes
// minting safe under webhook redelivery: the second pass finds the first
// issue and files nothing. (The key never reaches GitHub — the service strips
// it and encodes it as a label.)

// mintFixIssue files the fix issue for a component whose build stayed red
// through its automatic re-trigger. It carries the three facts a coding agent
