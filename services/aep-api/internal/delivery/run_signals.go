// The milestone-run signal vocabulary: what the EVENT PLANE tells the RUN
// SUPERVISOR. It is deliberately a separate, small set from the task-keyed
// signals above (signals.go), which belong to the tag-keyed workflows.
//
// The direction is one-way and total: the event plane detects, mints and
// signals; the supervisor decides. Every name below is therefore a statement
// of FACT about the world ("the PR merged", "this component's build is red"),
// never an instruction ("re-dispatch"). A supervisor that misses one recovers
// from ground truth — the reconcile sweep and the cycle-boundary poll exist
// precisely so a lost signal costs latency, not correctness.
