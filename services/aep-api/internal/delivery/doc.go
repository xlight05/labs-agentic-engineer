// Package delivery is the Delivery Pipeline domain (§3.3): it implements a
// versioned Spec end-to-end — plan Tasks, route Executions through the ONE
// funnel, dispatch coding agents, build/deploy components, and run validation.
//
// Its internal shape is the shared-kernel-ROOT + feature-sub-package layout of
// §10.3.1: anything referenced across feature boundaries is a TYPE or PORT that
// lives HERE in the root, and each feature (validation, and — as the fold
// proceeds — execution, taskflow, buildpipe, codingdispatch, devflowwork) is a
// sub-package importing only the root. That layout is what preserves the §1
// task ⊥ execution boundary as an internal one (taskflow and execution are peer
// sub-packages sharing only the root Dispatcher port + taskmeta + executions
// rows) while making every former feature→feature edge a legal slice→root type
// reference.
//
// The root is intentionally near-empty today: `validation` (S2S validation
// context/credentials, no cross-edges) is the first feature to land and needs
// no shared kernel. The kernel fills in as execution/devflow arrive.
