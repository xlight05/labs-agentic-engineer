// planning legitimately mints nothing. With no task filed, nothing will ever
// judge this version — which is exactly the dev ending that DOES close the
// milestone (delivery.SettleClosesTheMilestone).
//
// Case 2 is why case 1 is gated on plansItsOwnMilestone rather than on the cycle
// count alone. A task run fires on a label write, and GitHub's issue index lags a
// write (see validation_issues.go, which records a read-back that answered "no
// validation issue" for one this platform had just filed); a run that polled
// before the labelled issue was indexed would read an empty working set with no

// forever. Every budget in the system is defeated at once, and the symptom is an

// else's work — an ordinary task run's — as is the conflict issue the event plane
// mints for a validation pull request that will not rebase. Halting those would
// break the repair chain rather than protect a budget, so the activity is skipped
// outright rather than called and asked to do nothing.
//

// work of a species, no live run, start one" — so without this the run the user
// just cancelled is restarted within a tick, dispatches an agent, and the cancel
// button reads as having done nothing but cost money. Closing the issues is the
// suppression; the label is the way back.
//
// WHAT it closes is per KIND (delivery.InCancelledWork), and the dev case is
// deliberately wider than any working set: a cancelled BUILD abandons the whole
// increment, so the dispatch GATES go with the working set and the milestone is
// closed behind them. That is the asymmetry with the halt: a halted run may be
// retried in the same version, so its gates still name dependencies somebody has
// to resolve, and closing them would erase the record of what the version was
// waiting on.
//
// Two populations survive even a build's cancel. The version's VALIDATION TASK,
// because it is a handle on software still deployed. And the LEDGER — a human's
// unarmed note is not the platform's to close, and closing it would put a machine
// comment on somebody's own record.
//
// A task run's cancel reaches only the bugs and conflicts it was working. The
// version it works is the DEPLOYED one and is not being abandoned, so its plan,
// its validation task and its milestone are untouched, and the way forward is to
// reopen the bugs or file new ones.
//
// A VALIDATION run closes nothing here, and that is a decision rather than an
// omission. Its consequence is the version's validation task, and settleJudged
// already closes that on EVERY ending — scoped to the task this run ADOPTED,
// which is the narrowing that matters: a run cancelled before its first read
// adopted nothing, and the task stays open for the next trigger. Reaching the
// milestone from here would close it anyway and turn "validate again" into
// "file the task again".
//
// Nothing is REVERTED. Commits a cycle merged stay on `main` and components it
// promoted keep serving, so closing the milestone says the increment was
// abandoned — never that the release was withdrawn.
