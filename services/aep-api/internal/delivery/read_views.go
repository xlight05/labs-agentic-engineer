package delivery

import "time"

// The shared task/execution READ DTOs (§10.3.1): the projected shapes every
// reader join produces. They live in the delivery ROOT rather than the taskflow
// sub-package because they cross a feature boundary — the `build` sub-package's
// task-list read consumes TaskView through its TaskReader port, and a build must
// not import taskflow (slice ⊥ sibling). Keeping them here is what lets both the
// task reader (producer) and the build reader (consumer) name the same type
// while each imports only the root. They carry no behaviour and no gorm — the
// task Reads service in the taskflow sub-package builds them from live GitHub
// facts fused with the executions rows.

// The derived-status vocabulary a Task view can carry.
//
// It is DEGRADED, on purpose. The old algebra derived ten values by joining
// GitHub facts with per-issue execution rows; the milestone model writes no
// per-issue execution rows, so the only honest facts left about a Task are the
// ones GitHub holds about its issue. Two values are derivable from those alone:
// the issue is open, or the issue is closed — and an agent closes an issue by
// merging a pull request that references it.
//
// The two strings are deliberately members of the retired ten-value set. The
// console consumes derivedStatus through an UNTYPED contract field (there is no
// enum), so removing values breaks nothing but inventing one would: a chip
// keyed on an unknown string renders as nothing. Anything richer than this
// belongs on the run's cycle timeline, which is where the loop's real position
// lives.
