// Second line of defense for credentials in agent-pod output.
//
// The runner scrubs its own stdout (runners/remote-worker progress/scrubber.ts),
// which is the only place a token's exact value is known and can be redacted by
// literal match. This package is where raw pod stdout/stderr crosses into
// user-visible surfaces — the console build-log feed and the persisted final
// log — so it redacts by SHAPE as well: a runner regression, a line authored by
// a library rather than by us, or a git subprocess message must not be able to
// turn pod output into a credential disclosure.
//
// Shape-based matching is deliberately narrow. It cannot catch an opaque token
// (that is the runner's job); it does catch the families that have actually
// leaked here, and it never depends on knowing a secret's value.
