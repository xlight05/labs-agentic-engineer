// Package provisioning is the coordinating feature for dependency provisioning
// on our GitHub-native funnel (dependency-management §3.6). It rebuilds the
// value/param-collection surface upstream expressed as component_tasks + a
// projector, re-based onto aep:provision GitHub issues + a provision Execution
// kind + the funnel's dependency-kind-aware gate.
//
// It owns:
//
//   - EnsureProvisionIssues — mint one aep:provision gate issue per distinct
//     external / platform-resource dependency in the approved design (deduped
//     per project). The consumer coding task holds until each derives deployed.
//   - ValueService — external value collection: split values by the registered
//     schema, write secrets to SM-API + author the OC external Resource model,
//     then Finish the provision Execution + close the issue + Reevaluate
//     (external readyWhen:${true} → completion is synchronous).
//   - ResourceService — platform-resource provisioning: author the OC Resource +
//     binding (async) and admit a running provision Execution; the readiness
//     watcher observes the binding's native Ready condition out-of-band.
//   - ResourceWatcher — the resource-readiness watcher (cloned from the exec
//     watcher): on the binding going Ready it Finishes the provision Execution
//     (→ deployed), closes the issue with the binding reference, and Reevaluates
//     so gated consumer tasks dispatch. A 30-minute stale bound fails a stuck run.
//   - StatusService — the masked status read (outputs by name only — secrets
//     live only in SM-API / the OC-rendered Secret, never in a response).
//
// The no-secrets invariant holds throughout: secret VALUES go only to SM-API /
// OpenBao; issue bodies, comments, and API responses carry only names / paths /
// references. This package coordinates provisioners (dependencies/resources) +
// GitHub issues (gitrepo); every other collaborator (executions store, funnel
// Reevaluate, design read, repo lookup) is a narrow local port wired in the
// composition root.
