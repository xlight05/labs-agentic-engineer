package provisioning

// roles_gate.go — the build-time roles gate.
//
// A project whose design declares roles gets one `provision` gate per version,
// titled "Provision roles and test users", alongside the per-dependency gates.
// The ensure that resolves it runs synchronously in this same call, so the gate
// is minted, published to and closed in one pass on the happy path.
//
// **The ticket is also the credential channel.** Before closing, the gate posts a
// comment carrying every test account's username and password: that comment is
// where the validation agent reads the login it signs in with
// (skills/aep-validation, ADR-0022). Two rules follow, and both are enforced
// below. A ticket that cannot be filed, or a comment that cannot be posted,
// FAILS THE BUILD — an account nothing can read is the silent degradation this
// gate exists to prevent. And a password reaches the issue comment and nothing
// else, so every log line and failure reason on these paths is redacted.
//
// **Why its own gate, rather than folding into the `thunder-app` dependency
// gate.** Build preflight deliberately skips a dependency whose OpenChoreo
// binding is already Ready, so on every rebuild `thunder-app` carries no input,
// `provisionResource` is never called, and `settleReadyGates` re-authors
// nothing. A role added in v2 would then never be created. The roles gate is
// therefore driven by the DESIGN at the tag, not by the drawer inputs — it is
// minted on every build that declares roles, whether or not anything else needs
// provisioning.
//
// **What failure does.** Nothing a coding agent does depends on these existing:
// it writes role-matching code from `security.json`, not from live directory state.
// The gate earns its keep when the ensure FAILS — if the IdP is down and the
// roles never appear, a full coding → build → deploy → validate cycle would end
// in a meaningless verdict, because validation cannot sign in.
//
// So a failure here is reported as a ProvisionFailure, and the caller collapses
// the failure list into one error (`app/build_adapters.go`): the run SETTLES as
// failed at planning rather than waiting on a hold. That is stronger than a
// dispatch hold, not weaker — nothing downstream starts at all. The gate issue
// is left OPEN as the durable record of why, carrying the error in its body, and
// the next build re-runs the ensure — it is idempotent — and closes it.

//
// The table is four columns — Username, Password, Roles, Scopes — and the last
// two are why v2 changed it. A v2 account may hold SEVERAL roles, so a singular
// Role column could only ever name one of them; and the scopes are the thing the
// reader actually needs, because they say which criteria this login can exercise
// before anybody opens a browser. They are published rather than derived because
// deriving them means reading security.json and re-doing the union the ensure
// already did.
//
// The TRAILER carries the two values a login cannot mint a token without. The
// ISSUER, because there is one identity provider per environment and the same
// username on another one is a different account with a different password. And
// the RESOURCE — the project's resource-server identifier — because the token
// endpoint narrows an access token to one audience: a client that asks for the
// wrong `resource`, or for none, gets a token the gateway refuses. The third
// line is the refresh rule, which is the one piece of behaviour that surprises
// an agent mid-run: a token minted before a grant was added never gains it, so
// "the role has the scope but the call 401s" is answered by signing in again.
//
// No escaping, and each half of that is a rule somewhere else. A username is
// `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]*` and a role name is letters, digits, spaces, "-", "_"
// and "." — both enforced by securityspec's referential gate
// (MsgInvalidTestUsername, MsgRoleNameInvalid), which refuses the document
// before it can acquire a tag. A handle is `[a-z][a-z0-9-]*` by the schema. A
// generated password is drawn from an alphabet that excludes the backtick and
