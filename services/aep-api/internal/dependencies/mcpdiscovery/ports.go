package mcpdiscovery

// Consumer-side ports for the MCP discovery surface. This child package depends
// on collaborators through narrow interfaces wired concretely at the
// composition root (app.Build, D5). Each is satisfied structurally by an
// existing type in the parent `dependencies` package:
//
//   - ExternalResourceReader ← *dependencies.ExternalResourceCatalog (Task 3 —
//     org-namespaced OpenChoreo ResourceTypes, not the external_resources table)
//   - OrgEndpointLister       ← *dependencies.Catalog (C1)
//   - ResourceTypeLister      ← *dependencies.ResourceTypeCatalog (C3)

// ExternalResourceReader is the read slice of the org external-resource catalog
// the MCP surface exposes (list every registered external resource, get one by
// name). Sourced from the org's OpenChoreo ResourceTypes via
// openchoreo.ExternalDefinitionFromRT. Ensure authors the RT at
// register, so a zero-consumer Registered row is already listable here (MCP
// List is RT-backed; the agent JSON view carries consumptionInstructions and
// resourceDocs pointers). A design-only `external` dependency that never went
// through register/Ensure still has no RT and is not discoverable. Get returns
// (nil, nil) when the name is not registered.

// OrgEndpointLister is the read slice of the org endpoint catalog — the
// published-service targets an `org-service` dependency can point at (List),

// discovered OpenAPI contract (ListResolved) for the A3 MCP tool
// (list_org_component_endpoints).

// GroupCatalogLister reads the GROUPS that already exist on the environment
// directory of the org — the catalog the design agent consults before naming a
// group in `security.json`'s `roles[].assignTo`. A group is a set of people and
// is owned by the organisation, which is precisely what makes reuse meaningful,
// and it is why the rows carry who is in it and who already depends on it and
// nothing about what it can do.
//
// It takes the ORG HANDLE because the catalog is per (org, environment): every
// environment has its own identity provider, so "which groups exist" has no
// cluster-wide answer. The handle is the verified `ocOrgId` claim and never a
// tool argument — a model naming the org would be a model choosing whose
// directory it sees.
//
// Satisfied by *identity.CatalogService. Read-only with no write counterpart
// anywhere on this surface — groups are created at BUILD time, deterministically,
// never by a model.
//
// The type says GROUP and not "role" deliberately: a directory group is a set of
// PEOPLE the org owns, while a role is project-owned (`<project>/<Role>`) and is
// converged to the tag by the build. Only the first is a catalog to reuse from.

// GroupCatalogEntry is one row of the group catalog as the tool renders it. It is

// PlatformResourceConsumerLister derives, per installed platform ResourceType,
// the components across the calling org's projects that declare a
// platform-resource dependency on it (the "used by" overlay on the resource-type
// catalog). Keyed by lowercased ResourceType name. Satisfied structurally by
// *provisioning.Service (PlatformResourceConsumersByType) — kept as a narrow
// port so this cluster-global catalog package never imports the org-scoped
// provisioning package concretely. The overlay is additive and best-effort: a
// nil lister or an error degrades to an empty "used by", never failing the list.

// MUST refuse (ErrOwnerNotInOrg) any `owner` that is not the org credential's
// GitHub account, so a caller in one org can never read another org's repos.
