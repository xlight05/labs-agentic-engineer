// The git-provider capability ports.
//
// These interfaces are the provider-neutral seam between gitrepo's domain
// services and whatever git host actually serves the requests. The GitHub
// implementation lives in clients/github and is selected by GIT_PROVIDER; a
// GitLab/Gitea impl would be a sibling package satisfying the same ports with
// zero consumer changes. The seam is capability-sliced by CONSUMER need so each
// domain service depends only on the verbs it drives.
//
// Every call takes a secrets.Credential (or an App minter / raw token) —
// the client is the only place that mints Authorization headers, so tokens
// never cross a service boundary. All ports/types are stateless and
// concurrency-safe.
//
// The sentinels the implementations must return (ErrRepoNameConflict,
// HTTPStatusError codes, ...) and the wire DTOs (IssueResult, IssueInfo,
// GitHubUser, ...) are part of this contract — see errors.go and wire.go.
// The orgcreds validator keys off the sentinels, so any provider impl MUST
// reproduce them. Repo CONTENT (blobs/trees/commits/refs/tags) never goes
// through these ports: it runs on the Workspace engine (workspace.go /
// internal/platform/gitfs).

// RepoAdmin is the repository-lifecycle surface. Consumed by repoService
// (CreateRepo / EnsureBareRepo). Repo delete/get are DB operations in
// repoService itself; the host only provisions the remote repo.
