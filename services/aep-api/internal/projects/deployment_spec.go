// The desired-state PROJECTION for one component's deployment: design facts in,
// the two OpenChoreo objects the platform owns out. Pure — no I/O, no clock, no
// cluster — so the whole matrix (protected / unprotected, browser / service
// caller, auto-RCA on / off, siblings present / absent) is a table test rather
// than a cluster round trip.
//
// It replaced a reconcile SERVICE. The difference is not the code, which is
// largely the same rules; it is when they run. A sync answered "what has
// drifted, and how do I repair it" AFTER OpenChoreo had already rendered and
// served the component. This answers "what should be true" BEFORE the binding
// is written at all, which is what makes the trait config and the release pin
// land in one object write — and therefore what removes the window where a
// protected API served unauthenticated because its jwtAuth config had not been
// written yet.

// DesiredDeployment is everything the platform wants true of one component,
// split by the object it lands on and therefore by WHEN it can be written.
//
// The split is forced by OpenChoreo, not chosen: a ComponentRelease freezes the
// Component's trait list at release time, so the SHAPE has to be on the
// Component CR before the build cuts the release, while the per-environment
// CONFIG can only be written once a release exists to bind. Both halves come
// out of this one function precisely because they must agree — a trait attached
// without its config does not degrade, it fails the whole ReleaseBinding
// render.
