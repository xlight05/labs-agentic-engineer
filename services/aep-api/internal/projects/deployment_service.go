// It is the ONLY writer of a user component's ReleaseBinding. That is the point
// of the type, not an incidental property: three services used to patch
// disjoint fields of the same object on three different triggers, each soft

// else to retry. Under one writer the object is created complete, so there is
// no partial state to retry out of.

// nothing promotes a release except a call to Deploy — which is what lets the
// run supervisor place validation after the version is genuinely serving,
// rather than after a build merely asked for a deployment.
