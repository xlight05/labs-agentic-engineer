// code-first Huma operations (organization.RegisterOrgGitHub). Only the unscoped
// connect callback remains a raw handler here.

// registerConnectCallbackRoute mounts the App-mode connect callback
// OUTSIDE the JWT-protected mux. GitHub redirects the user's browser
// here with the OAuth code or post-install installation_id; we verify
// the connect-state JWT (issued by StartConnect) instead of the console
// JWT. This is an enumerated carve-out: the signed connect-state is the
// authn, bound to the org from that state (SourcePublisherCC, §6.6f).
