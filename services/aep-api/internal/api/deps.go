// Deps carries every feature service the strict handlers (handlers_*.go)
// call — nothing more: a field here means at least one handler reads it
// (fields whose only consumers were the retired Huma registrations were
// dropped at the extraction). main.go (internal/app) fills it with the real
// services; component tests fill only what the feature under test needs
// (untouched fields nil-guard or 503 in their handlers).
