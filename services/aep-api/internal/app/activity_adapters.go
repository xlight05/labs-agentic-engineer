// specAuthorship bridges the async gap between a room-scoped genai turn
// finishing and the collab committer later flushing that turn's doc edits to git
// (issue #239). A room turn writes into the shared doc and commits nothing; the
// committer flushes via files/apply, under the user's own token — so at the git
// layer the agent's work is indistinguishable from a manual edit and would be
// mis-attributed to the user. The turn is the only place agent authorship is
// still known, so it marks the exact paths its manifest touched; an apply whose
// commit contains a marked path is carrying agent text, claims those marks, and
// suppresses its (wrong) user line, because the turn already recorded the agent
// line.
//
// Marks are per path, not per project, because the committer holds agent-marked
// markdown until the session-end force flush: a user's own edit can land in an
// interim commit between the turn and that flush, and a project-wide mark would
// suppress the user's line and then label the eventual agent commit as the
// user — both halves inverted. Path scoping keeps the two flushes independent:
// the user's disjoint commit records as the user, the agent's paths stay marked
// until they actually land. A commit that mixes a marked path with user edits is
// one commit and one feed line, attributed to the agent (the agent line exists;
// a second line would double-report the commit). The state is in-process,
// matching the single aep-api replica of the deployment; a restart between a
// turn and its flush at worst mislabels that one flush as manual.
