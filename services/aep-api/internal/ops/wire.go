// The domain's ONE wire projection.
//
// It sits in the root rather than in a slice because all three slices return the
// report on the wire — the duplication is real and immediate, which is the
// domain-root's stated purpose (§5). It cannot sit in a sub-package: a slice
// importing a sibling is forbidden, and importing httpapi/ would be a cycle.
//
// Before P1 there was no mapping at all — the gorm model WAS the wire type, via
// the contract's `x-go-type: models.RcaAgentReport`. That is not available to a
// domain: internal/gen is imported by clients/ (bound for platform/clients), so
// pointing x-go-type at internal/ops would make the kernel import a domain and
// give every other domain a transitive dependency on this one. gen stays a leaf;
// the mapping is the price, and it buys a wire type with no OrgID on it.

// ToWire projects the domain entity onto the contract's shape.

// ToWireList projects a page of reports, PRESERVING nil.
//
// A nil page must stay nil: gorm's Find leaves an empty result nil, so an empty
// page has always marshalled to `"items":null`, and the contract marks items
// `nullable: true` to say so. Coercing to `[]` here would be a silent wire
// change — indefensible in a phase whose whole claim is that behaviour is
// unchanged. If null-items is wrong for the console, that is a product decision
// with a contract edit, not a side effect of moving a package.
