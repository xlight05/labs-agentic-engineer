// Package httpapi embeds the sourcecontrol slices into the one type the edge
// embeds, and assembles the domain from its Deps.
//
// It declares NO methods — a method here sits at depth-1 and silently shadows
// its slice (TestAggregatorsDeclareNoMethods). The assembly lives here, not in
// the domain root, because root→httpapi→slices→root would be a cycle.
