package naming

import (

)

// The workspace-naming vocabulary — the single source of the conventions that
// map a repo row to its on-disk location under repos/<org>/<project>/<slug>/.
//
// This is a pure leaf beside the gitfs engine — it imports only stdlib, so a
// package can use the workspace-naming vocabulary WITHOUT pulling in the engine's
// secrets.Credential dependency (which would cycle via models). gitfs OWNS the
// workspace layout (the engine
// creates repos/, computes RepoRef paths). It was previously in models/, where
// the reaper (a gitfs sub-package), four features, the domain, and the
// composition root each reached for it — one convention re-derived across
// uncoupled packages, the §11.3 smell. Now they share one contract in the
// package that defines the layout it describes. models/ re-exports these for
// legacy callers until each becomes a domain.

// SkillsRepoSentinelProjectID is the reserved git_repositories.project_id under
// which the per-org skills repo row lives (so it is distinguishable from real
// project repos). See docs/design/skills-repo-storage.md §10.1.
const SkillsRepoSentinelProjectID = "_skills"

// SkillsRepoDirName is the pinned on-disk directory leaf for the per-org skills
// repo on the shared workspace volume: repos/<orgId>/_skills/org-skills/. It is
// deliberately NOT the row's repo_slug (which is owner-prefixed and would change
// if the org reconnects under a different GitHub owner); the agents service
// derives the skills snapshot dir structurally from this fixed leaf. One org,
// one skills repo, one constant.
const SkillsRepoDirName = "org-skills"

// repoURLPattern extracts `<owner>/<repo>` from a GitHub HTTPS URL. Matches both
// `https://github.com/owner/repo` and `.../repo.git`.
var repoURLPattern = regexp.MustCompile(`github\.com/([^/]+/[^/]+?)(?:\.git)?/?$`)

// SlugForURL returns the canonical repo slug for a GitHub HTTPS URL — the
// `owner/repo` path lowercased with `/` replaced by `-`. Returns "" if the URL
// doesn't match the GitHub HTTPS pattern (caller decides whether to backfill or
// fail). Mirrors phase2.md §9.1.

// OwnerRepoFromURL extracts (owner, repo) from a GitHub HTTPS URL, preserving
// the original case (unlike SlugForURL, which lowercases). Returns empty strings
// if the URL doesn't match.

// WorkspaceSlug returns the on-disk directory leaf for a repo row on the shared
// workspace volume (design D6: a pure function of the row's identity). For the
// per-org skills repo the leaf is the pinned SkillsRepoDirName; for everything
// else it is repoSlug, backfilled from repoURL for pre-phase2 rows.
//
// A free function of (projectID, repoSlug, repoURL) rather than a method, so it
// does not require the GitRepository struct — which is exactly what lets the
// reaper compute a coordinate without importing the entity.
