// Package gitfs is the git-object engine over the shared workspace volume: one
// bare mirror per repo (`git clone --mirror`, never checked out), plumbing reads
// (rev-parse / ls-tree / cat-file / archive), plumbing writes via a throwaway
// index (read-tree / update-index / write-tree / commit-tree /
// `push --force-with-lease`), annotated tags, local diffs, and immutable
// per-SHA snapshot dirs for the agents mount.
//
// This package is the single definition point for the Workspace and
// SnapshotProvider ports, their DTOs, and the git sentinel errors. The domain
// alias surface lives in internal/feature/gitrepo/workspace.go — consumers
// import gitrepo.*, and the arch lock (internal/platform must stay
// feature-free) is honoured because the definitions live here.
