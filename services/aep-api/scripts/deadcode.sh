# Dead-code gate for aep-api.
#
# Runs golang.org/x/tools/cmd/deadcode — a whole-program Rapid Type Analysis
# that builds the call graph reachable from the cmd/aep-api main and reports
# every function/method NOTHING live reaches. It is run WITHOUT -test on
# purpose: tests do NOT count as consumers, so a function only a test calls is
# dead (delete it and its orphaned test). generated files (`// Code generated
# … DO NOT EDIT.`) are excluded by deadcode itself.
#
# Two categories are filtered out of the result — they are unreachable BY
# DESIGN, not dead:
#
#   1. Test-support packages ($EXCLUDE_RE): mocks, and the dbtest/gittest/
#      componenttest/… harnesses the suite runs on. They exist only to be
#      consumed by tests. Identified by dir name or the *_fortest.go suffix.
#   2. Functions carrying a `//deadcode:keep <reason>` marker in their doc
#      comment: intentional test seams that let tests drive live code, and
#      infrastructure retained but not yet wired (e.g. the OpenBao backend).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/deadcode.sh report   # human audit — prints findings, always exit 0
#   scripts/deadcode.sh check    # CI gate    — exit 1 if any finding survives

# deadcode must be BUILT with a Go toolchain >= this module's `go` directive: a
# binary built with an older toolchain refuses to load packages targeting a
# newer one ("package requires newer Go version go1.26"). Left to itself,
# `go run …/deadcode@vX` picks the toolchain from x/tools' OWN go directive and
# switches DOWN (v0.44.0 → go1.25.12), so with a go 1.26 module EVERY package
# fails to load. Same failure mode, same remedy as GO_TOOLCHAIN in the root
# Makefile (which pins the toolchain used to build golangci-lint) — pinning
# GOTOOLCHAIN to an explicit name disables the switch entirely.
#
# The version is derived from go.mod rather than hardcoded so it cannot drift
# from the module it analyses. An explicit pin is used instead of
# GOTOOLCHAIN=local because `local` would break a contributor whose installed
# Go predates the directive, where an explicit name just downloads it — the
# same auto-download a normal `go build` of this module already performs.
