# Generate `validation-criteria.json`

You are producing the **acceptance oracle** for the VALIDATION phase: a machine-readable list of
testable criteria derived from the requirement. Every downstream check (generated e2e tests, the
human sign-off checklist) is derived from this file, so **faithfulness to the
requirement matters more than volume** — a wrong or invented criterion silently corrupts every
downstream check.

This skill runs standalone (a turn asking only for criteria) or as the **final step of a
design-generation turn** — in both cases the requirement-only input rule below stands unchanged.

## Input — the requirement ONLY

Read the requirement prose from `specs/requirements/requirements.md` (or whichever requirements file the
user points you at). **Do not read `design.md`, `openapi.yaml`, or any source code** to derive criteria —
the oracle must be independent of the work it will grade. Base every criterion only on what the
requirement says or necessarily implies.

## Output — write exactly one file

Create `specs/validation/validation-criteria.json` (use `addFile`; if it already exists, replace its
contents). The file MUST be valid JSON conforming **exactly** to the schema below — no comments, no
trailing prose, no Markdown fences. Keep field order stable.

**Regeneration — keep ids stable.** When the file already exists in your workspace, keep each unchanged
criterion's `id` the same as in the existing file. Committed e2e specs are keyed by criterion id
(`tests/e2e/specs/<AC-ID>.spec.ts`), so renumbering an unchanged criterion would orphan its spec. Assign
a fresh id only to a genuinely new or reworded criterion.

```json
{
  "requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-001",
      "statement": "Users can reset their password via email",
      "criteria": [
        { "id": "AC-001-a", "must": "A registered email receives a reset link", "method": "e2e" },
        { "id": "AC-001-b", "must": "The reset link expires after 1 hour", "method": "e2e" },
        { "id": "AC-001-c", "must": "The reset confirmation message is clear and actionable", "method": "manual" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Field rules

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| `requirements[]` | One entry per distinct requirement parsed from the prose. |
| `requirements[].id` | `REQ-NNN`, assigned sequentially (`REQ-001`, `REQ-002`, …). |
| `requirements[].statement` | The requirement restated as one clear sentence. |
| `criteria[]` | The testable acceptance criteria for that requirement. **≥ 1 per requirement.** |
| `criteria[].id` | `AC-<req-number>-<letter>`, e.g. `AC-001-a`, `AC-001-b`. |
| `criteria[].must` | A single, **atomic**, verifiable assertion. No conjunctions — split "X and Y" into two criteria. |
| `criteria[].method` | Exactly one of `e2e` \| `manual` (see below). |

## Assigning `method`

- **`e2e`** — deterministically checkable by driving the app: a UI flow via a headless browser, or a
  deterministic API/CLI assertion for non-UI behavior. Prefer this whenever a stable pass/fail assertion
  is possible.
- **`manual`** — everything that cannot be checked by a deterministic e2e assertion: needs human
  judgment, exploratory interaction, or subjective evaluation (e.g. "the error message is clear and
  actionable", "the layout is usable on mobile"), or has external/physical/third-party side effects
  beyond an agent's reach.

When unsure, choose `e2e` if you can phrase a concrete deterministic assertion; otherwise `manual`.
Every criterion gets exactly one method.

## Discipline

- **Faithful, not inventive.** Every criterion must trace to something the requirement actually says or
  necessarily implies. Do NOT invent scope, endpoints, or features.
- **Atomic.** One independently checkable fact per criterion. Split compound requirements.
- **Deterministic.** The same requirement should yield substantially the same criteria each run.
- **Report ambiguity, don't fabricate.** If the requirement is ambiguous or missing acceptance detail,
  do NOT guess a criterion to fill the gap. Instead, **list the ambiguities and any assumptions you made
  in your reply to the user** — keep them OUT of the JSON file (the file stays exactly on-schema).

## Do not

- Do not add fields beyond the schema, comments, or any prose inside the JSON.
- Do not read `design.md`, `openapi.yaml`, or source code to derive criteria (requirement-only input).
- Do not generate e2e test files, a validation workflow, or anything else — this skill produces the
  single `specs/validation/validation-criteria.json` file, whether it runs standalone or as the final
  step of a design turn.
