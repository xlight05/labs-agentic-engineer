// PATTERN, not a verbatim copy. Copy this to <app-path>/src/authz/screens.ts
// and replace SCREEN_ROUTES with YOUR screens — the table below is the Expense
// Tracker fixture's, not a default. Everything else stays as it is.
//
// THIS IS THE ONLY FILE THAT KNOWS ABOUT SCREENS, and all it says about each
// one is which API operation it LOADS. The gate follows: a screen is reachable
// when the caller may call that operation, and what the operation needs is in
// the contract, projected into ./operations.gen.ts. Nothing here names a scope,
// a role or a handle, and security.json carries no screen table at all.
//
// WHY `loads` AND NOT A HANDLE. `scopes.has("claims:read")` written by hand into
// App.tsx is a stale handle the moment the design moves, and nothing — not tsc,
// not the build gate, not the mock walk — can see that it went stale. An
// OperationKey is a generated literal union, so a contract change that renames
// or drops the operation fails `npm run gen && tsc` on the next build.
//
// THE ORDER OF THIS TABLE IS THE RAIL'S ORDER, and its first reachable row is
// the screen the app lands on. Write the screens in the order the wireframes
// draw them.
