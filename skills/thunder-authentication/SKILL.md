description: How end-user identity works on the platform — Thunder, the IDP wired into the API gateway, signs users in and components authorize them. Covers the auth platform-resource dependency, the platform-owned OAuth client, the window._env_.<DEP>_* runtime keys, OIDC + PKCE in the SPA, and resolving the caller's role and directory record on the backend. Apply to any SPA whose users sign in, and to every protected backend they call.

# Thunder Authentication

End-user identity is delegated to Thunder, the platform's Identity Provider,
which the API gateway is wired to as its external IDP. That gives every project
with sign-in **two halves reading one claim set**:

- **The SPA** signs the user in with OIDC Authorization Code + PKCE and reads
  their claims from the ID token (`user.profile.groups`).
- **The protected backend** never sees a token: the gateway validates it and
  injects the SAME claims as headers (`X-User-Groups`). See `api-management` for
  the gateway's side of that contract.

It is one claim set, so the two sides must resolve a caller's role identically.

The OAuth client itself is **platform-owned**: you never create, compute, or
hardcode any part of it.

# SPA sign-in

## Order of work

`src/env.ts` (add the `<DEP>_*` keys to the `react-webapp` shim) → `src/auth.ts`
→ a **`/callback` route** that calls `handleCallback()` once on mount → the
bearer header in `src/api.ts`. Verify with the `react-webapp` build check.

## Constraints

**Keys are derived from YOUR dependency name.** The platform emits every
platform-resource dependency's outputs into `window._env_` as
`<UPPER_SNAKE(depName)>_<UPPER_SNAKE(outputName)>`. There is **no fixed prefix** —
it is the UPPER_SNAKE of the dependency `name` the architect chose. The auth
resource type outputs `client_id`, `issuer`, `jwks_url` and `scopes`, so a
dependency named `user-auth` yields:

| Key (dep `user-auth`) | Generic form | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `USER_AUTH_CLIENT_ID` | `<DEP>_CLIENT_ID` | this app's platform-owned OAuth client id |
| `USER_AUTH_ISSUER` | `<DEP>_ISSUER` | OIDC issuer / authority for `oidc-client-ts` |
| `USER_AUTH_JWKS_URL` | `<DEP>_JWKS_URL` | JWKS endpoint (token validation reference) |
| `USER_AUTH_SCOPES` | `<DEP>_SCOPES` | space-separated scopes (e.g. `openid profile email`) |

Hardcoding a fixed prefix — or any prefix other than YOUR dependency's name —
gives `undefined` at module load and a redirect to `undefined/oauth2/authorize`.

**`client_id` is platform-owned.** It is a platform-derived opaque identifier,
**not** the dependency's `name`; the platform delivers it in
`window._env_.<DEP>_CLIENT_ID`. Same for the client secret and the registered
redirect URIs. Never add Thunder client-provisioning code anywhere — the
platform's Thunder Application operator does it when the dependency provisions —
and never write a `/login` form that POSTs credentials to your own API.

**Compute the redirect URI; there is no key for it.** The platform registers the
SPA's served callback URL once its public URL resolves, and the SPA is served at
its host root (see `react-webapp`), so that URL is `<origin>/callback`.
Reconstruct exactly that in the browser: `window.location.origin + '/callback'`,
and serve the route at `/callback`. Post-sign-in landing is
`window.location.origin`. Neither is an env key.

**Token endpoint is cross-origin.** The browser posts straight to
`<DEP>_ISSUER/oauth2/token`; discovery is
`<DEP>_ISSUER/.well-known/openid-configuration`. Nothing is proxied same-origin,
which is why `react-webapp` does not proxy `/oidc/` — nginx only reverse-proxies sibling APIs under `/api`.

**Persist the session and renew silently.** The OAuth client is provisioned with
the `refresh_token` grant alongside `authorization_code` + PKCE, so an expiring
access token is renewed by posting the refresh token — no hidden iframe, no
third-party-cookie dependency. Store the session in `localStorage` (a
`WebStorageStateStore`) and set `automaticSilentRenew: true`. `sessionStorage` is
per-tab and wiped on close, which forces a re-login on every visit; and without
persistent web storage the PKCE verifier does not survive the redirect at all.

**There is no sign-out endpoint.** Thunder's discovery document advertises only
issuer, authorize and token — no `end_session_endpoint` — so
`signoutRedirect()` rejects. Sign-out drops the local session (`removeUser()`)
and reloads.

**Roles ride in the ID token.** `oidc-client-ts` surfaces them as
`user.profile.groups`, beside `ouId`/`ouName`/`ouHandle` and standard
`profile`/`email`. The platform requests the `group`/`ou` scopes by default, so
never decode the access token for roles and never hand-parse a JWT.

**Dev clusters** ship a default Thunder admin: `admin` / `admin`, in the
`Administrators` group. Real orgs add users via Thunder's admin console / SCIM.

## Implementation

Add the four `<DEP>_*` keys to the `Env` type in the `react-webapp` shim.

`src/auth.ts` — `oidc-client-ts` wired to `env.<DEP>_*`, with `redirect_uri`
computed from the origin (shown for a dependency named `user-auth` — use YOURS):

```ts
import { UserManager, WebStorageStateStore } from "oidc-client-ts";
import { env } from "./env";

export const userManager = new UserManager({
  authority: env.USER_AUTH_ISSUER,
  client_id: env.USER_AUTH_CLIENT_ID,
  redirect_uri: window.location.origin + "/callback",
  post_logout_redirect_uri: window.location.origin,
  response_type: "code",
  scope: env.USER_AUTH_SCOPES,
  // The token lives in JS-readable storage — acceptable for a public SPA; keep
  // loadUserInfo:false and lean on the platform CSP.
  userStore: new WebStorageStateStore({ store: window.localStorage }),
  automaticSilentRenew: true,
  loadUserInfo: false,
});

export async function signIn()         { await userManager.signinRedirect(); }
export async function handleCallback() { return userManager.signinRedirectCallback(); }

// No end_session_endpoint → signoutRedirect() rejects; drop the LOCAL session
// instead and let the load-time guard start a fresh sign-in.
export async function signOut() {
  try {
    await userManager.signoutRedirect();
  } catch {
    await userManager.removeUser();
    window.location.assign("/");
  }
}

// null ONLY when there is no session to renew — an expired one renews silently.
export async function currentUser() {
  const user = await userManager.getUser();
  if (user && !user.expired) return user;
  try { return await userManager.signinSilent(); } catch { return null; }
}

export async function getAccessToken(): Promise<string | null> {
  const user = await currentUser();
  return user?.access_token ?? null;
}

export async function getRoles(): Promise<string[]> {
  const user = await currentUser();
  const groups = user?.profile?.groups;
  return Array.isArray(groups) ? (groups as string[]) : [];
}
```

On app load, gate rendering on `currentUser()`: a user → proceed; `null` →
`signIn()`. Do **not** call `signIn()` merely because the access token expired —
that turns a silent refresh into a full-screen redirect and re-logs the user in
on every visit. `currentUser()` already renews silently.

`src/api.ts` — attach the bearer token; on 401 fall back to a full sign-in:

```ts
export async function listTodos() {
  const token = await getAccessToken();
  const res = await fetch(`/api/todos`, {
    headers: token ? { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` } : {},
  });
  if (res.status === 401) { await signIn(); return []; }
  return res.json();
}
```

# Backend authorization

The gateway hands your service the caller's verified identity as headers
(`api-management` covers the mechanism and the 401-on-missing-`X-User-Id` rule).
What follows is what that identity *means*.

## Identity is not authorization

`X-User-Id` is an **opaque IdP subject** — not a record key in any other service,
so a directory lookup keyed on it 404s. Split the two questions a caller raises:

- **Role** (what may they do) comes from ONE authority, and which one depends on
  whether the org publishes a directory: `X-User-Groups` when it does, the
  service's own people record when it does not (**Implementation** below). Either
  way, an authenticated caller with no role is a **403, never a 401**: a 401 tells
  the SPA its token expired, so it restarts sign-in and loops forever.
- **Directory attributes** (which unit is theirs, their own id in the directory)
  come from the caller's **directory record**, resolved by `X-User-Name` — the
  username, which the directory keys on. A group name is a role, not an identity,
  so never parse an attribute out of one, and never match `X-User-Id` against a
  stored record id. `X-User-Name` is gateway-set from the validated token so it
  is safe to authorize on, but a username can be renamed — so look the record UP
  by it, and never store it as a row key (`api-management` covers what to key on).

## Implementation

**One authority decides a caller's role, and the design picks which.** A published
directory owns roles through `X-User-Groups`; with none published, the service
owns them in its own people records. The two are alternatives, never a fallback
chain — a resolver that tries one and falls through to the other grants whatever
the weaker source says.

One resolver, called by every protected handler, whichever authority it reads.
**403**, never 401, when it yields no role: return the empty/absent case
explicitly rather than defaulting to the least-privileged real role, which is a
silent authorization grant.

### A directory is published — the role is in `X-User-Groups`

Resolve from the header, never by looking `X-User-Id` up anywhere. It arrives as
a JSON array (e.g. `["Compliance Admin"]`) — the SAME groups claim the SPA reads
from `user.profile.groups`; accept a comma-separated string as a fallback. Match
each group case-insensitively against the spec's role names: a substring match on
the keyword (`admin`, `auditor`) survives the org renaming its groups, an
equality check does not.

When roles scope by the caller's own directory attributes — their unit, their own
id — resolve the caller's **directory record** by `X-User-Name` and filter on
that record's fields:

- Missing `X-User-Name`, or a username that resolves to no record → **403**.
- An admin-equivalent role takes no filter; every other role filters on a field
  of the resolved record — never on `X-User-Id` (opaque) and never on a group
  name.

### No directory is published — the service owns its people records

Key them on `X-User-Id` — the one case where that is right, because the service
stored the subject itself rather than matching it against ids another system
minted — and fill display fields from `X-User-Name`.

**The stored record's role IS the role**, resolved by `X-User-Id`. Read
`X-User-Groups` for nothing on this path: no directory published those groups, so
they carry no authority here, and a token issued without a `groups` claim leaves
that header caller-controlled (`api-management`) — reading a role out of it lets
a caller name their own.

**A caller with no record yet gets one, at the cold-start role.**
`security-design`'s cold start says which role a first-time caller holds; create
that record on first sign-in, so a new user reaches the app's base experience
rather than a 403 nobody can clear. A roster in config is a demo fixture, not the
mechanism: it goes stale the moment somebody new signs in.

Express this in your stack's own idiom — where the resolver lives, its
signature, and how a handler returns 403 — following the conventions that skill
already sets. The directory's real endpoint, its username field, and the
dependency wiring are org-specific — `internal-services` owns them; do not
hardcode a roster.

## Pitfalls

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Signed-in user loops back to the login page forever | A protected handler answers no-role (or a failed directory lookup keyed on `X-User-Id`) with **401**; the SPA reads 401 as "token expired" and restarts sign-in | Return **403**. Resolve the role from the service's one authority — `X-User-Groups` with a directory, the stored people record without one — and never key a *directory* lookup on `X-User-Id`. |
| A role-scoped caller signs in but sees no rows | Scope derived the attribute from a group NAME (empty for a generic role group), or matched `X-User-Id` (an opaque subject) against a stored directory id (never equal) | Resolve the caller's directory record via `X-User-Name`, read the attribute from it, filter on that. |
| Every user shows no role / `groups` is empty | Roles read from the access token or a hand-decoded JWT | SPA: `user.profile.groups`. API: `X-User-Groups`. |
| Every signed-in user gets 403 and the app is unusable from a fresh deploy | The service requires a people record it has no way to create, or it creates one and then still resolves the role from `X-User-Groups` | Create the caller's record on first sign-in at the cold-start role, and resolve the role FROM that record — `security-design` owns which role that is. |
| Sign-in loops at the right path, or the user is sent to login on every visit / new tab | No persistent `WebStorageStateStore` (the in-memory default loses the PKCE verifier across the redirect), session in `sessionStorage`, or the load path calls `signIn()` on a merely-expired token | `WebStorageStateStore({ store: localStorage })` + `automaticSilentRenew`; renew via `signinSilent()` and only `signIn()` when there is no session. |
| After login, "invalid redirect URI" | `redirect_uri` doesn't match the `<origin>/callback` the platform registered | Compute `window.location.origin + '/callback'`. |
| Logout button does nothing | `signOut()` calls only `signoutRedirect()`, which rejects (no `end_session_endpoint`), and the handler swallows it | Wrap it in the try/catch fallback to `removeUser()` + reload. |
