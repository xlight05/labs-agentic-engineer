// Verification of the API gateway's signed assertion, and the caller it names.
//
// Copied VERBATIM from the `ballerina` skill — there is no line to edit.
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
//
// The gateway in front of this service has already done the authorization. It
// validated the caller's token against the environment's identity provider and
// checked the scope every operation declares in openapi.yaml; a request that
// failed either never reached this process. This file does NOT repeat that
// work. There is no operation -> scope table here, and a service that keeps one
// is keeping a second copy of the contract that nothing keeps in sync.
//
// What a gateway cannot do for you is prove to your own code that a request
// came through it: any pod that can open a socket to this service can send
// whatever headers it likes. So the gateway signs a JWT of the caller it
// authenticated -- the assertion -- and this file verifies it against ONE
// certificate the platform published for this environment. That signature is
// the whole trust anchor: no identity-provider JWKS, no introspection, no
// network call.
//
// So: the gateway decides WHETHER a request may happen. This file decides WHO
// it is from, in a way a forged header cannot fake.
//
// THE THREE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
//
// The platform sets all three on the container when the environment's gateway
// publishes a keypair (see the `api-configuration` trait):
//
//   GATEWAY_ASSERTION_CERTIFICATE  PEM X.509 certificate carrying the public key
//   GATEWAY_ASSERTION_ISSUER       the `iss` every assertion carries
//   GATEWAY_ASSERTION_HEADER       the header it arrives in
//
// A missing one PANICS the interceptor's init, which stops the service from
// starting. That is deliberate: a service that starts without them cannot tell
// a real caller from a forged one.
//
// WIRING: the generated `service / on ep0` becomes
//   service http:InterceptableService / on ep0 {
//       public function createInterceptors() returns AssertionInterceptor => new;
//       ...
//   }
// and a resource that needs the caller takes `http:RequestContext ctx` and
// calls `gatewayCaller(ctx)`.

#
# Three outcomes, and the middle one is the point:
#
# - no assertion  -> continue with no caller. The gateway serves a
#   `security: []` operation without one.
# - present but not verifiable -> 401, immediately. A forged or tampered
#   assertion is never downgraded to "anonymous": that would make forging one
#   strictly better for an attacker than sending none.
# - verified -> continue with the caller on the context.
# The three fields are the PEM text, the issuer and the header — all strings,
# and that is what keeps this class `isolated` so the listener serves requests
# concurrently. It does NOT cache the decoded `crypto:PublicKey`, for a reason
# worth knowing:
#
#   A `crypto:PublicKey` is not a readonly value, so an isolated object cannot
#   hold one in a final field. a readonly clone COMPILES and then fails at
#   runtime — MEASURED: the clone loses the native key material and every
#   assertion comes back "SHA256 signature verification failed", which reads
#   exactly like a wrong key. Do not reach for it.
#
# The cost of decoding per request was measured on this stack at ~73µs against
# ~422µs for the validation itself — about a sixth, for full concurrency.
# Dropping `isolated` to cache the key costs far more: Ballerina then serves
# this interceptor one request at a time.
