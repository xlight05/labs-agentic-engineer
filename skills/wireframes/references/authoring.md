# Authoring wireframes (design agent)

The companion to the `wireframes` skill for the design turn: where the screens
come from, what makes a set good, how roles split them, the proven anatomies,
and a complete worked example. The DSL grammar itself is in `SKILL.md`; this
file is about deciding what to draw with it.

## Where the screens come from — read the design first

You have up to three sources in context; read them in this order of priority:

1. **`specs/design/flows/`** and **`specs/design/domain-model.md`** — the
   flow files name the journeys the screens must serve (one key flow per
   file, actor first) and the domain model names the entities they display.
   This is your **primary** source for screens: derive the screen list from
   the flows first. (They may not exist on every turn — if absent, promote
   the requirements to primary.)
2. **`specs/requirements/`** (requirements / user stories) — the **coverage
   oracle**, and the detailed source. The numbered user stories are what the
   set has to cover (see *Cover every story* below); they also flesh out each
   screen and catch tasks the flow files only summarized: specific fields,
   states, rules, and edge cases (out-of-stock, guest vs. signed-in,
   validation errors).
3. **This component's `specs/design/components/<name>/design.json`** — a thin
   per-component summary; use it mainly to **scope**, not for screen content:
   its `type` (draw wireframes only for `web-application`), its one-line
   `description`, and its `dependencies` (e.g. an auth dependency means there's
   a signed-in vs. guest distinction → likely role-specific screens).

## Cover every story

The user stories are **numbered**, so coverage is countable. Count it
deliberately, before you write the file, while the requirements are in front
of you:

**Walk the numbered stories in order. For each one, name the `flow` block that
walks it** — the wireframe's own flows, not the `specs/design/flows/` files
you read them from. Each usually serves several stories, and a story may
appear in more than one; what matters is that every story is accounted for —
either walked, or knowingly set aside.

**Some stories have no screen, and that is correct.** Set a story aside when
the product genuinely gives it no view:

- **Sign-in and sign-out**, on a component with an auth dependency. "As a user
  I can sign in" is real, but the platform's SSO owns that page — there is no
  `Login` screen to draw (see *The DSL* in `SKILL.md`). The story is served by
  the auth dependency, not by a flow.
- **Backend rules and jobs** — a nightly export, a retention policy, a
  validation rule enforced in the API.
- **Machine-facing stories** — an endpoint another service calls.

Every other uncovered story is a gap: add the screens it needs and put them in
a flow.

Equally, don't invent screens the stories don't imply.

## What makes a wireframe good

A good wireframe reads like a real screen someone could use, and it explains
itself. What carries the quality:

- **Real content, not placeholders.** Write "Open risks: 24", "Platform team",
  "Overdue" — never "text here" or "label". The wireframe is a communication
  artifact; concrete content is what makes a layout legible and reviewable.
- **Say what each view is.** Give every screen a description (the quoted phrase
  after its name) so anyone can tell at a glance what the view does and who
  uses it — not just infer it from the widgets.
- **A clear visual hierarchy.** A page has a title, then primary content, then
  secondary detail. Use `heading` for section titles; put the most important
  thing first (it renders highest). A dominant action per screen (the
  `primary` button — usually one; two only when the screen truly has two
  equal main actions).
- **The right primitive for each thing.** A status is a `badge`, not text. A
  section switch is `tabs`. A person is an `avatar`. Picking the primitive that
  matches the real UI element is most of what makes screens feel real.

## Roles change the screens — always show them

Most real apps have more than one kind of user, and the *same feature looks
different for each*. This is the single most common thing wireframes get wrong:
they show one generic view and hide the fact that an admin and a regular user
actually see different screens. Don't do that.

**First, take the roles — do not re-derive them.** `specs/design/security.json`
already decided them: `roles[]` is the set, written from the PRD's actors before
this step runs. Use those names verbatim, so the wireframe, the permission
catalog and the console's Security page all say `FinanceReviewer` rather than
three near-misses. Only where that file does not exist — a design with no
sign-in — do you read the PRD and the design's flow files for distinct user
types (admin/manager/owner vs. member/employee/developer vs. viewer/customer).
If the app has more than one role, roles are in scope even when the prompt
doesn't say "per role."

**Then, for each role, show its main view and how it differs.** At minimum,
give every role its own `screen` for the primary task they do, named and
described for that role — because the difference is usually *capability*, not
cosmetics. The same feature splits into genuinely different screens:

- The one who **approves/administers** gets a queue or roster with the action
  and the columns to act on (Approve/Reject, an "assignee" column, bulk
  controls); the one who **submits/contributes** sees only their own items with
  a single Submit/Upload action — no approve, no assign.
- The one who **owns** a record edits it (an Edit form, private stats, a
  Reassign control); the one who **consumes** it sees the same record read-only,
  able at most to comment or take the one action meant for them.

Two roles, two screens — the admin's screen simply *has* buttons and columns the
member's does not. Show both.

Rules of thumb:

- Name the screen for its role and put the role in the description:
  `screen ReviewQueue "Manager reviews and approves pending requests"`.
- **Scope the chrome to the role.** An admin screen's `sidebar` lists the
  admin's destinations; a customer screen's lists the customer's. Real
  permissioned apps do not show people links they cannot use, and a prototype
  that does sends the reviewer down another persona's path.
- **Keep the overlap identical.** Items both roles have use the same label,
  the same order, and the same `navbar` brand, so the screens still read as one
  product rather than two. Only the role-specific entries differ.
- Reflect the real difference in **actions and data** — a role that can't
  approve/assign/delete simply doesn't have that button or column. Don't reskin
  one layout and call it two. The role difference should be legible from the
  screen itself, not spelled out in a caption.
- A screen that is genuinely identical for everyone (a public landing page, a
  generic detail page) stays single — don't fork it just to have a matching set.
- **Every screen you draw needs a `screens[]` row in `security.json`.** That
  file is written before this one, so a screen you add here is one it does not
  have — and a screen missing from `screens[]` is reachable by any signed-in
  person, which is never what a role-split wireframe means. When you finish the
  DSL, re-emit `security.json` with a row for every screen in it. The gate
  refuses the document that is short one, naming every screen it missed, so
  leaving it is not an option — only a later round trip.

## Proven screen anatomies

Most webapp screens are one of three shapes. Follow these anatomies — they're
what makes a wireframe read like a designed product instead of a pile of boxes.
(Every `navbar` includes a notification bell + account avatar at its top-right:
the compiler draws this account cluster as part of the `navbar` itself — don't
add your own.)

**Dashboard / landing** (top → bottom):

1. A small muted eyebrow (`text`, e.g. the team or context: "OPERATIONS"), then
   a `row` with a human `heading` ("Good morning — here's where things stand")
   and, after `right`, a `search` and a filter `select`.
2. A `row` of 3–4 stat-tile `card`s — `card "Open items | 47 | across 5 active
   projects"`. Every number gets its label and a caption that explains it. The
   row makes them equal-width automatically.
3. A `row` of rich entity cards (one per project/order/record): a `card` whose
   title is the entity, with nested children — a `progress "47/60"`, a meta
   `text` line ("47 of 60 tasks · Due 14 Sep"), and a status `badge`
   (`success`/`warning`: "On track"/"At risk") that docks to the card's corner
   automatically.
4. A `row` with a section `heading` ("Needs your attention") and, after
   `right`, the page's primary CTA. Then a `table` whose LAST column is the
   action — put "Review →" / "Follow up →" in each `row`'s final cell.

**List / queue**: `heading`, then a `row` of filter `badge`s with counts
("All (146)", "Open (23)", "Resolved (98)") or `tabs`, then a full-width
`table` with real `row`s — status as a word in a status column, owner, due
date, and a trailing action cell.

**Detail / record** (the screen for ONE item): `breadcrumb`, then a `row` with
the `heading` and its status `badge`s, a short description `text` — then a
`split 60/40`:

- **`left` (main)**: the item's content — a bordered panel `card` with detail
  `text` lines, an items/records `table` with rows, an "Upload new" / primary
  action.
- **`right` (rail)**: the collaboration side — a "Discussion" `card` with
  nested comment `text` lines (author + time + message), a `textarea` + "Post"
  `button`, then an "Activity" `heading` and timestamped `text` rows ("2 days
  ago — J. Alvarez uploaded report-final.pdf").

A record's conversation and history belong in this right rail, beside the
record — not on a separate screen. The divider between the columns is drawn
automatically. Keep each comment `text` SHORT (a phrase, not a sentence).

## Consistency rules

- **One shell, the design system's.** Every screen draws a brand-only
  `navbar` (`navbar "Acme"` — the compiler adds the bell and avatar) and a
  `sidebar` carrying that role's destinations. That is the app shell the
  design system's sample app has and the one the coding run builds, so the
  wireframe, the generated app and the sample line up one to one. Never put
  links in the `navbar`, and never draw a signed-in screen without the
  `sidebar` — a "simple" flow gets a short sidebar, not a different shell. A
  role-less public flow (a checkout) is the same shell with the public
  destinations in its `sidebar`. The one screen drawn with no chrome at all
  is a sign-in form the app **owns** (the DSL section above): it is built on
  the design system's gate layout, outside the shell, and nothing else is.
- Repeat the SAME `navbar` on every screen of one app. Repeat the SAME
  `sidebar` too, EXCEPT where a role's screens scope it to that role's
  destinations — the items both roles share still keep the same label and
  order, so the screens read as one product even when the rail isn't
  word-for-word identical.
- Comments start with `//`. A whole-line comment is safe anywhere; a trailing
  one is safe on an element line (`button "Escalate" primary  // in place`)
  but NOT inside a `flow` block, where a screen-name line is matched whole and
  a trailing comment rejects the write. Every screen should be reachable from
  some control's `-> Screen`, except a flow's entry screen — it is where the
  prototype opens, so nothing needs to point at it.

## Worked example — risk register webapp wireframes

A complete `wireframes.dsl` for a two-role desktop flow. The manager and the
owner each get their own dashboard and detail screen — a shared `RiskDetail`
would need two different sidebars, and a screen can only carry one, so each
role's landing view and remediation view are split in two. `navbar` stays
brand-only and identical everywhere; each `sidebar` lists only that role's
destinations, and the items both roles have (Overview, All Registers, Audits,
Settings) keep the same label and the same order — only the role-specific
entry (Review Queue vs. My Risks) differs. Note the rest of the rhythm: blocks
stack in reading order; `row` groups things side by side; each screen's main
action is its `primary` button; status is carried by `badge`s, not
prose. No coordinates anywhere — the compiler computes every position.

  MyRisks
  NewRisk
  RiskDetail
```

The two `flow` blocks close the file: each names its task, carries its `role`
and a one-line `description`, and lists only its own role's screens, entry
screen first. Each flow walks in the order it lists — `RiskQueue`'s "Review
next" CTA and its table both lead to `QueueRiskDetail`; `MyRisks`'s "New risk"
leads to `NewRisk`, whose "Create risk" lands on the new risk's `RiskDetail`
(`MyRisks`'s table reaches the same screen for a risk that already exists).
They are what the prototype's flow picker offers the reviewer —
the Manager's "Approval queue" walks queue-then-escalate, the Risk owner's
"Log a risk" walks log-then-remediate — and neither flow references a screen
the other role can't reach.

Checklist before finishing a wireframe file:

- Every screen from the requirements has a `screen` block; no extras, no
  duplicate takes on the same screen. Where a role changes the view, there's a
  screen per role, named and described for it.
- Every screen has a one-line description saying what it's for.
- `navbar` is brand-only and identical across every screen of the app; every
  screen has a `sidebar`, scoped to each role's destinations, with shared items
  kept at the same label and order across roles.
- Each role or journey named in the design's `flows/` files has its own `flow "<name>"` block,
  entry screen first, referencing existing screens by name.
- **Every numbered user story is accounted for**: walked by at least one flow,
  or on the set-aside list with its reason (sign-in, a backend rule, a job, a
  machine-facing endpoint). Go through the stories and say which for each —
  the one thing that must not happen is a story nobody looked at.
- **Each role flow opens on that role's own screen, and there is no `Login`
  screen when the component has an auth dependency** — the platform's SSO
  hosts sign-in and returns the user to their home screen, so the app never
  renders one. A shared `Login` at the head of every flow funnels every persona
  through one static `-> Screen` into the same dashboard. Sign-out is a navbar
  item with no arrow. Draw a sign-in screen only for an app that owns its own
  credentials, and then in one flow only.
- Labels are content-bearing ("Open risks | 24 | across 6 registers",
  "Platform team", "Overdue"), never placeholders like "text" or "label".
- The right primitive does each job — `badge` for status, `tabs` for section
  switching, `avatar` for people, `progress` for completion, `table` + `row`
  for real data.
- **Every `table` column and stat `card` value is data the provider returns
  for that screen.** Where the provider's `openapi.yaml` exists, check the
  list operation the table binds to: a column its response carries no field
  for (a per-row count that only a detail endpoint could supply) is either
  added to the API design now or dropped from the wireframe. Left in,
  the coding run either fills it with one request per row or drops it
  silently, and the reviewer sees a screen that does not match either way.
- Color is rare and meaningful: `primary` on each screen's main action
  (usually one, at most two equals), plus the odd status `badge`.
- Navigation is on the control that triggers it: the button/link/table that
  leads to another screen ends with `-> ScreenName`, and every target matches
  a real `screen`.
- **Every `primary` button carries a `-> Screen`**, or a `//` comment saying
  why its action completes in place. Walk the screens and check each one: a
  "New…"/"Invite…"/"Add…"/"Assign…" primary with no arrow means the form it
  opens was never declared as a screen — declare it and point at it.
- NO coordinates and no manual sizes unless an element truly needs one — the
  layout comes from stacking, `row`, and `split`.

## Updating existing wireframes

The DSL is line-oriented, so `editFile` works naturally: anchor on the
`screen <Name>` line plus the element line you're changing. Add a screen by
appending a new `screen` block. Add table data by inserting `row` lines under
the `table`. Insert a new element by adding its line where it should appear in
the stack — everything below it moves down automatically.
