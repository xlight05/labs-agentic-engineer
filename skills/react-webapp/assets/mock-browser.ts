// Mock mode — copied verbatim to <app-path>/mock/browser.ts, never edited.
// The handlers beside it are the app's; this file only starts them.
//
// THE ORDER IS THE DESIGN. MSW takes the first handler that matches AND
// answers; a resolver that returns nothing falls through to the next one. So
// the three layers below are the deployed request path, in the deployed order:
//
//   gatewayHandlers  the API gateway — may this caller call this at all? (401)
//   handlers         the service — the app's own data, ownership and 404s
//   unhandledApi     nothing answered: the mock's own gap, said out loud (501)

// Closes the API surface, and it has to be closed explicitly: MSW passes an
// unhandled request THROUGH to the network, so a call nobody wrote a handler
// for would otherwise reach the dev server and come back as index.html with
// status 200 — a successful response with an unparseable body, which reads to
// the caller as a working screen. 501 says unmistakably that it was the mock,
// not the app, that had no answer, and it cannot be confused with a 404 the
// contract genuinely declares.
