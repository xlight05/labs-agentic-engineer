// Projects an OpenAPI document's `security` blocks into the table
// `mock/gateway.ts` refuses from. This is the same reading the platform does
// when it renders the real gateway (aep-api's OpenAPIOperations), so the mock
// and the deployed API agree by construction rather than by review.
//
// It takes a PARSED document, not a file: the YAML parse lives in
// mock/plugin.ts, which is the only half that needs a dependency, and keeping
// the rules here means they can be exercised against plain objects.
//
// Every refusal below THROWS rather than degrading. A contract this cannot read
// is one the real gateway would also refuse to serve, and a mock that guessed
// would be green where the cell is 404 — which is the failure the whole layer
// exists to prevent.
