// Mock mode — copied verbatim to <app-path>/mock/gateway.ts, never edited.
//
// THE API GATEWAY, in mock mode. Production has two layers in front of a
// screen and they answer different questions:
//
//   the gateway   may this caller call this operation at all?  -> 401 if not
//   the service   which of these rows are theirs?              -> 404 if not
//
// `mock/handlers.ts` is the SERVICE. This file is the GATEWAY, and it is
// registered ahead of the handlers so the two stay as separate in mock mode as
// they are in a cell. A handler that does its own scope check is keeping a
// second copy of the contract — the exact drift this layer exists to remove.
//
// WHERE THE TABLE COMES FROM. `mock/plugin.ts` reads the sibling's
// `openapi.yaml` at dev-server start and puts it on `/env-config.js`, the same
// script that already carries `window._env_` and for the same reason: it is the
// one channel that is in place BEFORE the bundle runs. Nothing is transcribed
// and nothing is committed, so the mock cannot disagree with the contract the
// real gateway is rendered from. An app whose contracts declare no `oauth2`
// scheme gets a null table and no gateway at all, which is right: it has no
// sign-in to enforce.
//
// NOT Vite's `define`, which is the obvious reach and is wrong here: Vite skips
// define replacement for client modules in dev (`consumer === "client" &&
// !isBuild` returns early in vite:define), so the table would land in a
// production build nobody runs and be MISSING from `dev:mock`, which is the
// only way mock mode ever runs. The failure is silent — an undefined identifier
// reads as "no table", and the gateway disables itself.
//
// WHY 401 AND NOT 403. The real gateway answers 401 for every
// authentication-policy failure — no token, expired token, wrong issuer, wrong
// audience, MISSING SCOPE — with a byte-identical body and no
// `WWW-Authenticate`. Nothing downstream can tell those apart, which is the
// whole reason `src/api-client.ts` decides on its own `expires_at` instead.
// Answering 403 here would walk a branch of that rule the deployed app never
// takes, and leave the branch it does take — 401 while the token is still
// valid — untested. That branch is the one whose regression is an endless
// sign-in loop.
