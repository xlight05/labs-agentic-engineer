/**
 * Every sentence the security.json referential gate can say, keyed.
 *
 * Two gates apply this rule set — the agent's FileBundle write-gate (this
 * package) and `securityspec` in the BFF (Go) — and the design's contract is
 * that "a document that passes one passes the other". Two hand-kept copies of
 * twenty sentences would drift on the first reword, so the templates live here
 * once and are published as `security-design-messages.json` beside this file
 * (`pnpm --filter @aep/agent-stream gen`); Go vendors that artifact and a
 * parity test on each side asserts it still matches.
 *
 * A template is a flat string with `{placeholder}` slots. No nesting, no
 * pluralization, no conditionals: anything a template cannot say is said by
 * choosing a different key, so the Go formatter is a `strings.NewReplacer` and
 * nothing more.

  resource_component_unknown:
    'resource "{resource}" is owned by component "{component}", which specs/design/design.cell does not declare — the cell is the design\'s source of truth: add the node first, or name the service that really owns the resource.',

  // --- roles ---------------------------------------------------------------
  duplicate_role_name:
    'role "{role}" is declared twice — a role name identifies one role within the project (compared without case), so it appears once.',
  role_name_whitespace:
    'role "{role}" has leading or trailing whitespace — the name becomes "<project>/{role}" on the directory verbatim.',
  role_name_invalid:
    'role "{role}" is not a usable role name — use letters, digits, spaces, "-", "_" or ".". The name is published in the build ticket\'s markdown table and becomes "<project>/{role}" on the directory, so "|", "/" and line breaks cannot appear in it.',
  role_name_is_group_name:
    'role "{role}" is also declared in groups[] — a role is project-scoped (it becomes "<project>/{role}" on the directory) and a group is org-owned and shared, so one name cannot be both. Rename the role.',

    'role "{role}" grants "{handle}", which permissions[] does not declare — add the action to its resource, or grant a declared handle.',
  read_all_without_read:
    'role "{role}" grants "{allHandle}" without "{readHandle}" — the "all" handle widens the ROWS an operation returns, it does not replace the operation, and the gateway compares scopes whole-string. Grant both.',
  assignable_by_unknown_role:
    'role "{role}" names "{ref}" in assignableBy, which no roles[] entry declares — assignableBy names project roles, never org groups.',
  admin_role_needs_assign_to:
    'role "{role}" is an admin-enrolment user role with no assignTo — name at least one org group the role is assigned to (declare it in groups[] if this project introduces it), or set "enrolment": "self-service".',

    'role "{role}" is assigned to group "{group}", which groups[] does not declare — that is legal for a group the org directory already holds; the build gate resolves it against list_groups and refuses it there if it does not exist.',

  test_user_role_not_user_kind:
    'test user "{username}" holds role "{role}", which is not an admin-enrolment user role — a service role belongs to an app principal and a self-service role is taken at registration, so neither gets a test account.',

    'screen "{screen}" names component "{component}", which specs/design/design.cell does not declare — a screens[] row belongs to a web application the cell draws.',

  screen_requires_unknown_handle:
    'screen "{screen}" of component "{component}" requires "{handle}", which permissions[] does not declare — require a declared handle, null for any signed-in user, or "public".',
  screen_operation_not_granted:
    'role "{role}" reaches screen "{screen}" but does not grant "{handle}", which an operation behind that screen requires — the screen loads into a 401 that the SPA cannot tell from an expired session. Grant "{handle}" to "{role}", or gate the screen on a handle "{role}" does not hold.',
