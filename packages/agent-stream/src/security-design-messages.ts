/**
 * Every sentence the security.json referential gate can say, keyed.
 *
 * Two gates apply this rule set — the agent's FileBundle write-gate (this
 * package) and `securityspec` in the BFF (Go) — and the design's contract is
 * that "a document that passes one passes the other". Two hand-kept copies of
 * twenty sentences would drift on the first reword, so the templates live here
 * once and are published as `security-design-messages.json` beside this file
 * (`pnpm --filter @aep/agent-stream gen`); Go vendors that artifact and a
 * parity test on each side asserts it still matches.
 *
 * A template is a flat string with `{placeholder}` slots. No nesting, no
 * pluralization, no conditionals: anything a template cannot say is said by
 * choosing a different key, so the Go formatter is a `strings.NewReplacer` and
 * nothing more.

  duplicate_role_name:
    'role "{role}" is declared twice — a role name identifies one role within the project (compared without case), so it appears once.',
  role_name_whitespace:

  role_name_is_group_name:
    'role "{role}" is also declared in groups[] — a role is project-scoped (it becomes "<project>/{role}" on the directory) and a group is org-owned and shared, so one name cannot be both. Rename the role.',

  admin_role_needs_assign_to:
