/**
 * Agent SSE event contract — the typed, documented surface over the main spec
 * agent's turn stream.
 *
 * The wire stays RAW `StreamPart` (the SDK's `TextStreamPart`, one frame per
 * part); this module does NOT add an envelope. It exists so the producer (the
 * Express SSE route in `server.ts`), the eval, and the playground share ONE
 * definition of: the emitted event catalog, the payloads carried inside the
 * frames (`OpResult`, the per-tool `*Input` shapes), the reviewable `Change`
 * projection, and the turn-request body (`TurnRequest`).
 *
 * Ownership: this module is the leaf source of truth for the wire, published by
 * the `@aep/agent-stream` package so the producer (the agents service SSE
 * route), the fold consumers (evals, playground, console), and the BFF share ONE
 * definition. The domain (`bundle.ts`) and the agents-service `tool.ts` import
 * these types and their Zod schemas carry a compile-time drift guard asserting
 * they stay assignable to the `*Input` types here — so there is no
 * hand-maintained parallel copy. This stream is NOT part of the generated
 * OpenAPI contracts in `packages/contracts` (raw AI SDK frames aren't
 * OpenAPI-representable); the package stays free of any AI-SDK dependency.
