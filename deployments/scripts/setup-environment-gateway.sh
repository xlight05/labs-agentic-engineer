# Gives an environment its own API Platform gateway. One gateway per (org, env),
# never one per cluster: the gateway is where a managed API's authentication is
# terminated, and an environment's APIs must be terminated against THAT
# environment's identity tier — the environment Thunder (T2)
# setup-environment-thunder.sh provisions — and against nothing else.
#
#   RestApi label   gateway.api-platform.wso2.com/restapi-target
#                     = api-platform-<org>-<env>
#   APIGateway      api-platform-<org>-<env> in namespace <org>-<env>
#   runtime Service api-platform-<org>-<env>-gw-gateway-gateway-runtime

#
# Every one of those five names is the CHART's derivation, not this script's
# invention — see the chart's _helpers.tpl (apiGatewayName, restApiTarget,
# gatewayHostname, runtimeUrl). Three other places in this repo must agree with
# them and are commented to say so:
#   * manifests/api-platform/api-configuration-trait.yaml (and the platform
#     chart's copy) — the RestApi label and the Backend host:port
#   * services/aep-api/internal/projects/gateway_address.go — APIGatewayHost
#   * verify-convergence.sh check 5 — every Environment has its gateway
#
# ── Where the identity half comes from ──────────────────────────────────────
#
# The gateway's `ThunderKeyManager` is read from the BINDING ConfigMap that
# setup-environment-thunder.sh writes (labels aep.wso2.com/kind=thunder-binding
# + /org + /env). Not from a naming derivation, and not from the platform IdP:
# the binding is the record of the instance that actually exists for this
# environment, whichever publisher created it. No binding ⇒ this script stops,
# because a gateway wired to a guessed issuer fails as a 401 on the
# environment's APIs with nothing pointing back here.
#
# Consequence, and the point of the second tier: a platform-IdP (T1) token is NOT
# valid at an environment's gateway, and neither is a sibling environment's T2
# token. Only the environment's own T2 is a keymanager here.
#
# ── Two modes ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#   CREATE  no deployed release for (org, env) → install the chart.
#   BIND    a deployed release exists (Agent Manager created it, or an earlier
#           run did) → no helm upgrade. Same publisher rule the T2 script
#           follows: never upgrade a release you did not create. The binding is
#           still checked against what the release is actually configured with,
#           and a mismatch is reported loudly rather than silently converged.
#
# Inputs (all optional):
#   AMP_API_URL        Agent Manager's API (default in env.sh).
#                      Whether it ANSWERS decides bootstrap.enabled — the chart's
#                      pre-install hook Job registers the gateway in Agent
#                      Manager, and there is nothing to register with on a
#                      cluster where Agent Manager was torn down.

# ── The gateway's backend-JWT assertion keypair ─────────────────────────────
# What a service downstream of this gateway verifies. The `backend-jwt` policy
# makes the gateway mint an RS256-signed JWT of the AUTHENTICATED caller into
# `x-jwt-assertion` on every upstream request; the service verifies it against
# the public half and thereby knows the request came through the gateway and
# not from a pod that reached it directly. That is the one thing a gateway
# cannot prove with a header, and the reason a generated service no longer
# needs a scope table of its own.
#
# One keypair per (org, environment), for the same reason there is one gateway:
# a shared key would let any environment's gateway mint an assertion any other
# environment's service believes.
#
# Generated once and left alone on re-runs. Rotating it is a deliberate act —
# every service in the environment has the old public key in its environment
# until it is redeployed, so a rotation that is not followed by a redeploy of
# every protected component is an outage.
#
# The verification half is published as a self-signed X.509 CERTIFICATE, not as
# a bare SPKI public key, because that is the shape both target stacks can read:
# Ballerina's `crypto:decodeRsaPublicKeyFromContent` takes certificate content
# and nothing else, and Go's `x509.ParseCertificate` gets the key out of one in
# a line. The certificate carries no trust of its own — it is a container for
# the public key, verified by nothing and pinned by the platform that published
# it. Ten years, because it is not the expiry that retires this key: rotating
# the keypair is (see above).
#
# The SECRET is the source of truth; the values below feed the private half to
# the gateway from it. It is read back rather than held from the generating
# branch so both paths — fresh and preserved — take the same one. Typed
# kubernetes.io/tls with the conventional tls.key/tls.crt keys, so the day the
# gateway chart exposes a volume pass-through it can be mounted as-is.
#
# ⚠️  The private half reaches the gateway as `signingkey.inline`, which the
#     gateway-extension chart renders into a ConfigMap in this namespace IN
#     PLAINTEXT. The policy also accepts `signingkey.path` (a PEM file), and
#     the gateway chart has `gatewayRuntime.deployment.extraVolumes` /
#     `extraVolumeMounts` to mount this Secret at one — but the extension chart
#     (1.0.0-rc2) passes neither through, exposing only `systemExtraEnv`. Until
#     it does, anyone with namespace read here can read the signing key. Do not
#     treat this environment's assertions as a security boundary against an
#     attacker who already has that access.
