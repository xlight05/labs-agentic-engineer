# Builds the runner image (runners/remote-worker/Dockerfile — ONE image for both
# task kinds: Debian + Go + Playwright + baked chromium) and imports it into the
# local k3d cluster. This is the LOCAL/DEV path: every machine builds the :dev
# tag once — self-contained, no shared registry needed. Dispatch reads it via
# the compose AGENT_RUNNER_IMAGE env, which defaults to the same tag built here.
#
# For released platforms the image is published to GHCR as
# ghcr.io/wso2/aep/remote-worker:<version> by .github/workflows/release.yml
# and wired into aep-api via the platform Helm chart's codingAgentRunner.image.
#
# Idempotent: the (multi-minute, downloads chromium) build is skipped when the
# image already exists. FORCE=1 rebuilds — use it after changing the Dockerfile
# or the runner's TS/toolchain (skill edits are picked up live via the plugin
# hostPath overlay and never need a rebuild).
#
# SKIP_IMPORT=1 builds without importing — used by setup.sh, which starts this
# build in the background before the cluster exists and leaves the import to
# setup-aep.sh so the multi-GB node import runs exactly once.
#
# Called by setup-aep.sh (build + import at setup) and `make build-runner`.
