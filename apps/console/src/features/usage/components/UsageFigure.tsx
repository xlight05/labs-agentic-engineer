// cost (captured usage the platform could not price) degrades to tokens. On the

// Rendered as a PLAIN value rather than a chip (PR #300 review): a chip frames
// a value as one tag among several, and a card carries exactly one figure here
// — the frame bought no distinction and only added weight. Reach for a chip
// again only if this row ever lists more than one value.
