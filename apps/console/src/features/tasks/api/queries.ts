 * A version's issues, live from GitHub (state=all — a merged PR auto-closes
 * its issue, so `open` would hide everything that landed).
 *
 * `tag` scopes the read to one version by MILESTONE MEMBERSHIP; it is also
 * what makes bare ledger issues visible, since they carry no label to query
 * on. Omitted = every version's agent work and gates, ledger excluded.
 *
 * `live` is the run state, passed down: the run row is the page's single
 * liveness driver now, so this list no longer decides for itself whether to
 * keep polling by inspecting a task's derivedStatus — after the flip that
 * only says whether a GitHub issue is open.
