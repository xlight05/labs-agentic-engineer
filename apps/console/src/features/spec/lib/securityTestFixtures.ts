/**
 * Expense Tracker — the worked example the Security page was designed against —
 * as the three files the page reads it from.
 *
 * It is here rather than in `src/mocks` because it is the SPEC being asserted,
 * not a convenience: the example fixes this exact matrix, down to which cells
 * are filled and which handle carries the "used nowhere" warning, so a test
 * that quietly simplified it would stop being evidence. The document is kept as
 * TEXT, in the on-disk form, so the grant toggle's round-trip claim can be made
 * against it.
