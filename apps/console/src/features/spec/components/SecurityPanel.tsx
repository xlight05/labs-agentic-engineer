/**
 * Spec → Security: one scroll over `security.json` v3, in two sections.
 *
 * **Groups, roles & users** comes first — the people: every org group this
 * design touches, then a card per role. **Permissions** is the matrix, every
 * handle the project declares against every role a person can hold.
 *
 * The cast before the grid. A reader meeting the matrix first meets a column
 * header per role and no way to learn what any of them is for; meeting the
 * roles first, the columns are already names they know.
 *
 * Groups and roles were two sections and are now one. The split meant a group
 * and the role that uses it were never on screen together, and a REUSED group
 * had no row at all — it existed only as a chip inside whichever role card
 * named it. The standing prose each section carried (how the identity provider
 * works, what a test account is for) is gone from the page body: the first is
 * said per group by its New / Existing chip, the second hangs on the ⓘ beside
 * the test user it is about.
 *
 * It is the console's first WRITE into a spec room. One cell is one edit: the
 * room's CURRENT text is patched (`patchGrants`) inside the write itself, and
 * the room echoes the result back as a new `securityJson`. Nothing is held
 * optimistically — there is no second copy of the truth to reconcile, and a
 * write that the room refuses simply never arrives.
 *
 * Everything else on the page stays read-only. Adding a resource, an action or
 * a role touches `openapi.yaml` and `wireframes.dsl` too, so it is a design
 * conversation; the matrix says so in its intro, ABOVE the grid — a reader has
 * to know it before they go hunting for a control that is not there, not after.
