/**
 * One role, as a card in a grid: what it is for, which PRD stories it serves,
 * who may hand it out, which org groups carry it and who signs in as it.
 *
 * The card says nothing about WHICH handles the role grants — the matrix below
 * is where grants are read and compared, and repeating them here would give a
 * reader two places to check and one of them would eventually be stale. It says
 * nothing about whether a group already exists either: that is the Groups list
 * above, once per group, rather than once per role that names it.
 *
 * What the card is sized for is a grid cell. Four roles at full width were four
 * bands of whitespace and most of the page's scroll.
