/**
 * The Security panel's LIVE half: what the platform actually created on the
 * identity provider, as opposed to what the design declares.
 *
 * The design half comes from the collab room (`securityDesign.ts`), so the two are
 * read from different places on purpose — the room shows an edit the moment it
 * is made, and this shows the world as it was at the last Build. Rendering them
 * side by side is what makes "new at Build" and "already there" legible.
 *
 * Reveal is a POST and its answer is never cached: a password is
 * a deliberate, momentary disclosure, not a value a query client should hold and
 * re-serve. Rotate and delete stay on the BFF; this panel does not call them.
