// THE BUILD-SESSION SPINE — one build session as the sequence it actually is:
// the agent writes code, opens a pull request, the platform merges it, the merge
// fans out to builds, and a green build deploys itself.
//
// Every applicable stage exists from the moment the session does. That is the
// whole point: the surface this replaced drew a stage only AFTER it happened
// (the build list returned nothing before a merge SHA), so everything between
// "the agent pushed" and "builds exist" was rendered nowhere, and a session
// stalled on a declined merge looked exactly like one still thinking.
//
// A stage that has not been reached says WHAT IT WAITS FOR. A stage that went
// wrong says so in the platform's own recorded words — `mergeReason` — rather
// than leaving the reader to infer a stall from an absence.
//
// Every derivation here is pure and reads only facts the platform actually
// learned: the cycle row (webhook-fed), the milestone's issues, and the cluster
// read for builds. Nothing is inferred from elapsed time.

/**
 * The issues a build session worked, with how the console knows.
 *
 * `exact` is the difference between a fact and a good guess. Once a pull request
 * exists the platform has recorded the merge policy's matched set, which is
 * precisely what the merge closes. Before that, the only honest answer is the
 * milestone's open agent-work — right in the common case, wrong if the working
 * set changes mid-session — so the caption says which one the reader is looking
 * at rather than presenting both as the same claim.
