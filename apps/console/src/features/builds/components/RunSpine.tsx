//
//   1  Provisioning     the connections this version needs
//   2  Coding agent     the runner Job, up to the pull request it opens
//   3  Pull request     the handover from agent to platform
//   4  Merge            the auto-merge policy's decision
//   5  Builds           the fan-out one merge causes
//   6  Deployment       a green build deploys itself
//
// One rail, one sequence, numbered straight through. A fix or conflict session
// re-enters at Coding agent and keeps counting (7, 8, …) under a label saying
// which session it is — the loop is real, and pretending a re-entry is a fresh
// start would hide the very thing a reader is trying to understand.
//
// Provisioning leads because that is the order the platform works in: the
// dispatch predicate is run-level, so no session starts while any gate is open.
// It appears only when the version needs connections at all.
//
// This replaced a two-level layout — a run rail whose entries were collapsible
// sessions, each holding its own five-dot sub-spine. Two orderings on one screen
// is one too many; the dots summarising a sequence that is now always on screen
// summarised nothing.
