// The run card's "why nothing is moving" panel.
//
// Deliberately NOT a MUI `Alert`. Alert's filled severity backgrounds are the
// loudest surface in the console, and this panel sits inside a card that
// already carries a state chip — two of them stacked (a run's hold, and the
// issue list's own gate banner underneath) turned an ordinary build into a page
// that looked like an incident. This is the same SOFT tint StatusChip uses for
// exactly that reason: the tone's own colour at low alpha, the tone's own text,
// and a rule down the leading edge so the panel reads as attached to the card
// rather than dropped on top of it.
//
// The palette family is read off the theme, never hardcoded, so the panel
// follows the active Oxygen theme like every other status surface.
