/**
 * The Security panel's live half in mock mode.
 *
 * Scenarios, not just the happy path. The panel's most interesting states are
 * the awkward ones — a role the platform does not own, a username that already
 * belongs to somebody, a directory that is down — and none of them is reachable
 * on demand against a real identity provider. They are switchable here by
 * project name so the whole panel is developable without a backend:
 *
 *  - any project              → the full catalog, four project roles, three
 *                               test-user states, and `Finance` bound in two
 *                               projects so the cross-project count is visible
 *  - `roles-offline`          → `directoryAvailable: false`
 *  - `roles-empty`            → a design that declares no roles
 *  - `roles-locked`           → every mutation 404s (the org/project fence)
 *
 * The response is the whole `ProjectRolesView`, `projectRoles[]` included:
 * `roles` is the shared org-group catalog and `projectRoles` is what this
 * project owns, and the two stay two lists exactly as the contract keeps them.
