// The `/design` mock stream (#576): a design run that DECLARES its plan.
//
// Exercises every grilled state: the plan arriving in two waves (the cell
// first — only the cell fixes the component set), the union dedupe (wave two
// restates design.md and nothing doubles), planned → writing → done off the
// ordinary file frames, and — with `fail` in the instruction — a turn that
// dies mid-write, leaving done ticks, one error, and a ghost.
//
// Wave one publishes through the streamed-input path (tool-input-start/delta/
// end) AND the complete tool-call, the belt-and-braces pair the fold dedupes;
// wave two is a bare tool-call. Both real paths stay covered.
