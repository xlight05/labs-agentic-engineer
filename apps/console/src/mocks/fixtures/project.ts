## Goal

A small storefront where customers browse the product catalog, add items
to a cart, and check out.

## Requirements

- Browse products by category with search.
- Cart persists across sessions.
- Checkout with a mocked payment provider.
- Order history per customer.
`;

const userStories = `# Demo Shop — User stories

- As a shopper, I can search the catalog so that I find products quickly.
- As a shopper, my cart survives a page reload so that I don't lose picks.
- As a shopper, I can check out and see an order confirmation.
- As a returning customer, I can see my past orders.
