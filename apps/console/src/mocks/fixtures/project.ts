 * answered an envelope tagged `v3` carrying a run that belongs to v1 — a fixture
 * that contradicts its own envelope, and exactly the kind of thing that makes a
 * mock stop being evidence.
 *
 * Restamping identity alone was not enough either: the `building` scenario has
 * v3 running, v2 failed and v1 completed, and handing all three the same
 * `waitingRun` showed a run still waiting for versions that had finished. The
 * story is therefore chosen by the BUILD'S OWN STATUS, so the run page and the
 * ledger row can never disagree about what happened to a version.
 *
 * A tag the scenario never built gets an EMPTY run list, which is what the real
 * server answers for a version it has no runs for.

A small storefront where customers browse the product catalog, add items

## Requirements

- Browse products by category with search.
- Cart persists across sessions.
- Checkout with a mocked payment provider.
- Order history per customer.

// report exactly this.
const unsettledPrd = `# Demo Shop — PRD

## Goal

A small storefront where customers browse the product catalog, add items
to a cart, and check out.

## Requirements

- Browse products by category with search.
- Cart persists across sessions *assumed* for 30 days.
- Checkout with a mocked payment provider *assumed* card only.
- Order history per customer *assumed* last 12 months.

## Open Questions

- Which payment provider goes live first?
- Does checkout need guest orders, or is an account required?

- As a shopper, my cart survives a page reload so that I don't lose picks.
- As a shopper, I can check out and see an order confirmation.
- As a returning customer, I can see my past orders.

// The security design (#665): ONE document, and the Security rail entry reads
// it alone. v2 — a permission catalog the roles grant from.
//
// Shaped on the canonical Expense Tracker fixture
// (`packages/agent-stream/test/fixtures/security/expense-tracker.json`) and
// renamed onto this project's own components, so the mock exercises the same
// matrix the design pictures: two resources on two components, an own/any
// split, a `read-all` widener, and one action (`catalog:export`) no role grants
// — the matrix's "granted by nobody" row.
//
// Every state the Security page can reach is reachable from here, because none
// of them is reachable on demand against a real identity provider:
//
//  - the three group badges, against `fixtures/roles.ts`: `Compliance` is
//    absent from the live catalog ("New at Build"), `Administrators` is there
//    but not the platform's ("Not ours"), `Finance` is the platform's and holds
//    roles in two projects ("Reused");
//  - `Shopper` is SELF-SERVICE — a user-kind column that is still a column, with
//    no group and no promised login;
//  - `Viewer` names no test user, so the panel promises `test-viewer` and the
//    live half agrees;
//  - `jsmith` holds TWO roles, which is what v2 changed;
//  - `ledger-sync` is SERVICE-kind — no login, no group, its own list.
//
// Screens are exactly the three `storefront/wireframes.dsl` declares, one of
// each kind: `public`, `null` (any signed-in account) and a handle.
